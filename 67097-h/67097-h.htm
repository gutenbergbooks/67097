  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>It has been no easy task to revise this volume in such
a way as to make it more worthy of the favour with
which it has been received. Most of it has had to be
rewritten in the light of certain discoveries made since
the publication of the first edition, above all, that of
the extracts from Menon’s Ἰατρικά, which have furnished,
as I believe, a clue to the history of Pythagoreanism.
I trust that all other obligations are duly acknowledged
in the proper place.</p>

<p class='c002'>It did not seem worth while to eliminate all traces
of a certain youthful assurance which marked the first
edition. I should not write now as I wrote at the age
of twenty-five; but I still feel that the main contentions
of the book were sound, so I have not tried
to amend the style. The references to Zeller and
“Ritter and Preller” are adapted throughout to the
latest editions. The Aristotelian commentators are
referred to by the pages and verses of the Berlin
Academy edition, and Stobaeus by those of Wachsmuth.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>No apology is needed for the appearance of a work
dealing with Early Greek Philosophy. The want of
one has long been felt; for there are few branches of
philology in which more progress has been made in
the last twenty years, and the results of that progress
have not yet been made accessible to the English
reader. My original intention was simply to report
these results; but I soon found that I was obliged to
dissent from some of them, and it seemed best to say
so distinctly. Very likely I am wrong in most of
these cases, but my mistakes may be of use in calling
attention to unobserved points. In any case, I hope
no one will think I have been wanting in the respect
due to the great authority of Zeller, who was the first
to recall the history of philosophy from the extravagances
into which it had wandered earlier in the century.
I am glad to find that all my divergences from his
account have only led me a little further in the path
that he struck out.</p>

<p class='c002'>I am very sensible of the imperfect execution of
some parts of this work; but the subject has become
so large, and the number of authorities whose testimony
must be weighed is so great, that it is not easy for any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>one writer to be equally at home in all parts of the
field.</p>

<p class='c002'>I have consulted the student’s convenience by
giving references to the seventh edition of Ritter and
Preller (ed. Schultess) throughout. The references to
Zeller are to the fourth German edition, from which
the English translation was made. I have been able
to make some use also of the recently published fifth
edition (1892), and all references to it are distinguished
by the symbol Z<sup>5</sup>. I can only wish that it had appeared
in time for me to incorporate its results more thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c002'>I have to thank many friends for advice and suggestions,
and, above all, Mr. Harold H. Joachim, Fellow of
Merton College, who read most of the work before it
went to press.</p>

</div>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The cosmological character of early Greek philosophy.</div>

<p class='c002'>I. It was not till the primitive view of the world
and the customary rules of life had broken down, that
the Greeks, began to feel the needs which philosophies
of nature and of conduct seek to satisfy. Nor were
those needs felt all at once. The traditional maxims
of conduct were not seriously questioned till the old
view of nature had passed away; and, for this reason,
the earliest philosophers busied themselves mainly
with speculations about the world around them. In
due season, Logic was called into being to meet a fresh
want. The pursuit of cosmological inquiry beyond a
certain point inevitably brought to light a wide divergence
between science and common sense, which was
itself a problem that demanded solution, and moreover
constrained philosophers to study the means of defending
their paradoxes against the prejudices of the unscientific
many. Later still, the prevailing interest in logical
matters raised the question of the origin and validity
of knowledge; while, about the same time, the breakdown
of traditional morality gave rise to Ethics. The
period which precedes the rise of Logic and Ethics has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>thus a distinctive character of its own, and may fitly be
treated apart.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The primitive view of the world.</div>

<p class='c002'>II. Even in the earliest times of which we have any
record, the primitive view of the world is fast passing
away. We are left to gather what manner of thing it
was from the stray glimpses we get of it here and there
in the older literature, to which it forms a sort of sombre
background, and from the many strange myths and
stranger rites that lived on, as if to bear witness of it to
later times, not only in out-of-the-way parts of Hellas,
but even in the “mysteries” of the more cultivated
states. So far as we can see, it must have been essentially
a thing of shreds and patches, ready to fall in
pieces as soon as stirred by the fresh breeze of a larger
experience and a more fearless curiosity. The only
explanation of the world it could offer was a wild tale
of the origin of things. Such a story as that of
Ouranos, Gaia, and Kronos belongs plainly, as Mr.
Lang has shown in <cite>Custom and Myth</cite>, to the same
level of thought as the Maori tale of Papa and Rangi;
while in its details the Greek myth is, if anything, the
more savage of the two.</p>

<p class='c002'>We must not allow ourselves to be misled by metaphors
about “the childhood of the race,” though even
these, if properly understood, are suggestive enough.
Our ideas of the true state of a child’s mind are apt to be
coloured by that theory of antenatal existence which has
found, perhaps, its highest expression in Wordsworth’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span><cite>Ode on the Intimations of Immortality</cite>. We transfer these
ideas to the race generally, and are thus led to think
of the men who made and repeated myths as simple,
innocent creatures who were somehow nearer than we are
to the beginning of things, and so, perhaps, saw with a
clearer vision. A truer view of what a child’s thoughts
really are will help to put us on the right track. Left
to themselves, children are often tormented by vague
terrors of surrounding objects which they fear to confide
to any one. Their games are based upon an animistic
theory of things, and they are great believers in luck
and in the lot. They are devotees, too, of that “cult of
odds and ends” which is fetishism; and the unsightly
old dolls which they often cherish more fondly than
the choicest products of the toy-shop, remind us
forcibly of the ungainly stocks and stones which
Pausanias found in the Holy of Holies of many a
stately Greek temple. At Sparta the Tyndaridai were
a couple of boards, while the old image of Hera at
Samos was a roughly-hewn log.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>On the other hand, we must remember that, even
in the earliest times of which we have any record, the
world was already very old. Those Greeks who first
tried to understand nature were not at all in the
position of men setting out on a hitherto untrodden
path. There was already in the field a tolerably
consistent view of the world, though no doubt it was
rather implied and assumed in ritual and myth than
distinctly realised as such. The early thinkers did a
far greater thing than merely to make a beginning.
By turning their backs on the savage view of things,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>they renewed their youth, and with it, as it proved, the
youth of the world, at a time when the world seemed
in its dotage.</p>

<p class='c002'>The marvel is that they were able to do this so
thoroughly as they did. A savage myth might be preserved
here and there to the scandal of philosophers;
fetishes, totems, and magic rites might lurk in holes and
corners with the moles and with the bats, to be unearthed
long afterwards by the curious in such matters. But
the all-pervading superstition, which we call primitive
because we know not how or whence it came, was gone
for ever; and we find Herodotos noting with unfeigned
surprise the existence among “barbarians” of beliefs
and customs which, not so long ago, his own forefathers
had taught and practised quite as zealously as ever did
Libyan or Scyth. Even then, he might have found
most of them surviving on the “high places” of
Hellas.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Traces of the primitive view in early literature.</div>

<p class='c002'>III. In one respect the way had been prepared
already. Long before history begins, the colonisation
of the islands and the coasts of Asia Minor had
brought about a state of things that was not favourable
to the rigid maintenance of traditional customs and
ways of thought. A myth is essentially a local thing,
and though the emigrants might give the names of
ancestral sanctuaries to similar spots in their new homes,
they could not transfer with the names the old sentiment
of awe. Besides, these were, on the whole, stirring
and joyful times. The spirit of adventure is not
favourable to superstition, and men whose chief
occupation is fighting are not apt to be oppressed
by that “fear of the world” which some tell us is the
normal state of the savage mind. Even the savage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>becomes in great measure free from it when he is
really happy.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>1. Homer.</div>

<p class='c002'>That is why we find so few traces of the primitive
view of the world in Homer. The gods have become
frankly human, and everything savage is, so far as may
be, kept out of sight. There are, of course, vestiges of
early beliefs and practices, but they are exceptional.
In that strange episode of the Fourteenth Book of
the <cite>Iliad</cite> known as <cite>The Deceiving of Zeus</cite> we find a
number of theogonical ideas which are otherwise quite
foreign to Homer, but they are treated with so little
seriousness that the whole thing has even been regarded
as a parody or burlesque of some primitive
poem on the birth of the gods. That, however, is to
mistake the spirit of Homer. He finds the old myth
ready to his hand, and sees in it matter for a “joyous
tale,” just as Demodokos did in the loves of Ares and
Aphrodite. There is no antagonism to traditional
views, but rather a complete detachment from them.</p>

<p class='c002'>It has often been noted that Homer never speaks
of the primitive custom of purification for bloodshed.
The dead heroes are burned, not buried, as the kings of
continental Hellas were. Ghosts play hardly any part.
In the <cite>Iliad</cite> we have, to be sure, the ghost of Patroklos,
in close connexion with the solitary instance of human
sacrifice in Homer. All that was part of the traditional
story, and Homer says as little about it as he can.
There is also the <cite>Nekyia</cite> in the Eleventh Book of the
<cite>Odyssey</cite>, which has been assigned to a late date on the
ground that it contains Orphic ideas. The reasoning
does not appear cogent. As we shall see, the Orphics
did not so much invent new ideas as revive old ones,
and if the legend took Odysseus to the abode of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>dead, that had to be described in accordance with the
accepted views about it.</p>

<p class='c002'>In fact, we are never entitled to infer from Homer’s
silence that the primitive view was unknown to him.
The absence of certain things from the poems is due
to reticence rather than ignorance; for, wherever
anything to his purpose was to be got from an old
story, he did not hesitate to use it. On the other
hand, when the tradition necessarily brought him into
contact with savage ideas, he prefers to treat them with
reserve. We may infer, then, that at least in a certain
society, that of the princes for whom Homer sang, the
primitive view of the world was already discredited by
a comparatively early date.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>2. Hesiod.</div>

<p class='c002'>IV. When we come to Hesiod, we seem to be in
another world. We hear stories of the gods which are
not only irrational but repulsive, and these stories are
told quite seriously. Hesiod makes the Muses say:
“We know how to tell many false things that are like
the truth; but we know too, when we will, to utter what
is true.”<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> This means that he was quite conscious of
the difference between the Homeric spirit and his own.
The old light-heartedness is gone, and it is important
to tell the truth about the gods. Hesiod knows, too,
that he belongs to a later and a sadder time than
Homer. In describing the Ages of the World, he inserts
a fifth age between those of Bronze and Iron. That
is the Age of the Heroes, the age Homer sang of. It
was better than the Bronze Age which came before it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>and far better than that which followed it, the Age of
Iron, in which Hesiod lives.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a> He also feels that he is
singing for another class. It is to shepherds and
husbandmen he addresses himself, and the princes for
whom Homer sang have become remote persons who
give “crooked dooms.” For common men there is no
hope but in hard, unceasing toil. It is the voice of the
people we now hear for the first time, and of a people
for whom the romance and splendour of the Greek
Middle Ages meant nothing. The primitive view of the
world had never really died out among them; so it was
natural for their first spokesman to assume it in his
poems. That is why we find in Hesiod these old,
savage tales, which Homer disdained to speak of.</p>

<p class='c002'>Yet it would be wrong to see in the <cite>Theogony</cite> a
mere revival of the old superstition. Nothing can ever
be revived just as it was; for in every reaction there is
a polemical element which differentiates it completely
from the earlier stage it vainly seeks to reproduce.
Hesiod could not help being affected by the new
spirit which trade and adventure had awakened over the
sea, and he became a pioneer in spite of himself. The
rudiments of what grew into Ionic science and history
are to be found in his poems, and he really did more
than any one to hasten that decay of the old ideas which
he was seeking to arrest. The <cite>Theogony</cite> is an attempt
to reduce all the stories about the gods into a single
system, and system is necessarily fatal to so wayward
a thing as mythology. Hesiod, no less than Homer,
teaches a panhellenic polytheism; the only difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>is that with him this is more directly based on the
legends attached to the local cults, which he thus sought
to invest with a national significance. The result is that
the myth becomes primary and the cult secondary, a
complete inversion of the primitive relation. Herodotos
tells us that it was Homer and Hesiod who made a
theogony for the Hellenes, who gave the gods their
names, and distributed among them their offices and
arts,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and it is perfectly true. The Olympian pantheon
took the place of the old local gods in men’s minds, and
this was as much the doing of Hesiod as of Homer.
The ordinary man had no ties to this company of gods,
but at most to one or two of them; and even these
he would hardly recognise in the humanised figures,
detached from all local associations, which poetry had
substituted for the older objects of worship. The gods
of Greece had become a splendid subject for art; but
they came between the Hellenes and their ancestral
religions. They were incapable of satisfying the needs
of the people, and that is the secret of the religious
revival which we shall have to consider in the sequel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cosmogony.</div>

<p class='c002'>V. Nor is it only in this way that Hesiod shows
himself a child of his time. His <cite>Theogony</cite> is at the
same time a Cosmogony, though it would seem that
here he was following others rather than working out
a thought of his own. At any rate, he only mentions
the two great cosmogonical figures, Chaos and Eros,
and does not really bring them into connexion with
his system. The conception of Chaos represents a
distinct effort to picture the beginning of things. It is
not a formless mixture, but rather, as its etymology
indicates, the yawning gulf or gap where nothing is as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>yet.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> We may be sure that this is not primitive.
Savage man does not feel called upon to form an idea
of the very beginning of all things; he takes for
granted that there was something to begin with. The
other figure, that of Eros, was doubtless intended to
explain the impulse to production which gave rise to
the whole process. That, at least, is what the Maoris
mean by it, as may be seen from the following
remarkable passage<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>From the conception the increase,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the increase the swelling,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the swelling the thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the thought the remembrance,</div>
      <div class='line'>From the remembrance the desire.</div>
      <div class='line'>The word became fruitful,</div>
      <div class='line'>It dwelt with the feeble glimmering,</div>
      <div class='line'>It brought forth the night.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Hesiod must have had some such primitive speculation
to work on, but he does not tell us anything clearly
on the subject.</p>

<p class='c002'>We have records of great activity in the production
of cosmogonies during the whole of the sixth century
B.C., and we know something of the systems of
Epimenides, Pherekydes,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and Akousilaos. As there
were speculations of this kind even before Hesiod, we
need have no hesitation in believing that the earliest
Orphic cosmogony goes back to that century too.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>The feature which is common to all these systems is
the attempt to get behind the gap, and to put Kronos
or Zeus in the first place. This is what Aristotle
has in view when he distinguishes the “theologians”
from those who were half theologians and half philosophers,
and who put what was best in the beginning.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a>
It is obvious, however, that this process is the
very reverse of scientific, and might be carried on
indefinitely; so we have nothing to do with the
cosmogonists in our present inquiry, except so far
as they can be shown to have influenced the course of
more sober investigations. Indeed, these speculations
are still based on the primitive view of the world,
and so fall outside the limits we have traced for
ourselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>General characteristics of early Greek cosmology.</div>

<p class='c002'>VI. What, then, was the step that placed the Ionian
cosmologists once for all above the level of the Maoris?
Grote and Zeller make it consist in the substitution of
impersonal causes acting according to law for personal
causes acting arbitrarily. But the distinction between
personal and impersonal was not really felt in antiquity,
and it is a mistake to lay much stress on it. It seems
rather that the real advance made by the scientific men
of Miletos was that they left off telling tales. They
gave up the hopeless task of describing what was when
as yet there was nothing, and asked instead what all
things really are now.</p>

<div class='sidenote'><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>Ex nihilo nihil.</i></span></div>

<p class='c002'>The great principle which underlies all their
thinking, though it is first put into words by
Parmenides, is that <em>Nothing comes into being out of
nothing, and nothing passes away into nothing</em>. They
saw, however, that particular things were always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>coming into being and passing away again, and from this
it followed that their existence was no true or stable
one. The only things that were real and eternal were
the original matter which passed through all these
changes and the motion which gave rise to them, to
which was soon added that law of proportion or compensation
which, despite the continual becoming and passing
away of things, secured the relative permanence and
stability of the various forms of existence that go to
make up the world. That these were, in fact, the
leading ideas of the early cosmologists, cannot, of course,
be proved till we have given a detailed exposition of
their systems; but we can show at once how natural it
was for such thoughts to come to them. It is always
the problem of change and decay that first excites the
wonder which, as Plato says, is the starting-point of
all philosophy. Besides this, there was in the Ionic
nature a vein of melancholy which led it to brood
upon the instability of things. Even before the
time of Thales, Mimnermos of Kolophon sings the
sadness of change; and, at a later date, the lament
of Simonides, that the generations of men fall like the
leaves of the forest, touches a chord already struck by
the earliest singer of Ionia.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Now, so long as men
could believe everything they saw was alive like themselves,
the spectacle of the unceasing death and new
birth of nature would only tinge their thoughts with a
certain mournfulness, which would find its expression
in such things as the Linos dirges which the Greeks
borrowed from their Asiatic neighbours;<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> but when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>primitive animism, which had seen conscious life everywhere,
was gone, and polytheistic mythology, which
had personified at least the more striking natural
phenomena, was going, it must have seemed that there
was nowhere any abiding reality. Nowadays we are
accustomed, for good and for ill, to the notion of
dead things, obedient, not to inner impulses, but solely
to mechanical laws. But that is not the view of the
natural man, and we may be sure that, when first it
forced itself on him, it must have provoked a strong
sense of dissatisfaction. Relief was only to be had
from the reflexion that as nothing comes from nothing,
nothing can pass away into nothing. There must,
then, be something which always is, something fundamental
which persists throughout all change, and
ceases to exist in one form only that it may reappear in
another. It is significant that this something is spoken
of as “deathless” and “ageless.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Φύσις</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='In.7'></a>VII. So far as I know, no historian of Greek
philosophy has clearly laid it down that the word
which was used by the early cosmologists to express
this idea of a permanent and primary substance was
none other than φύσις; and that the title Περὶ φύσεως,
so commonly given to philosophical works of the
sixth and fifth centuries <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> means simply <cite>Concerning
the Primary Substance</cite>. Both Plato and
Aristotle use the term in this sense when they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>discussing the earlier philosophy,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> and its history shows
clearly enough what its original meaning must have
been. In Greek philosophical language, φύσις always
means that which is primary, fundamental, and
persistent, as opposed to what is secondary, derivative,
and transient; what is “given,” as opposed to that
which is made or becomes. It is what is there to
begin with. It is true that Plato and his successors
also identify φύσις with the best or most normal condition
of a thing; but that is just because they held
the goal of any development to be prior to the process
by which it is reached. Such an idea was wholly unknown
to the pioneers of philosophy. They sought
the explanation of the incomplete world we know, not
in the end, but in the beginning. It seemed to them
that, if only they could strip off all the modifications
which Art and Chance had introduced, they would get
at the ultimately real; and so the search after φύσις,
first in the world at large and afterwards in human
society, became the chief interest of the age we have to
deal with.</p>

<p class='c002'>The word ἀρχή, by which the early cosmologists
are usually said to have designated the object of their
search, is in this sense purely Aristotelian. It is
quite natural that it should be employed in the well-known
historical sketch of the First Book of the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>;
for Aristotle is there testing the theories of
earlier thinkers by his own doctrine of the four causes.
But Plato never uses the term in this connexion, and
it does not occur once in the genuine fragments of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>early philosophers. It is confined to the Stoic and
Peripatetic handbooks from which most of our knowledge
is derived, and these simply repeat Aristotle.
Zeller has pointed out in a footnote<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> that it would be
an anachronism to refer the subtle Aristotelian use
of the word to the beginnings of speculation. To
Anaximander ἀρχή could only have meant “beginning,”
and it was far more than a beginning that the
early cosmologists were looking for: it was the <em>eternal</em>
ground of all things.</p>

<p class='c002'>There is one very important conclusion that follows
at once from the account just given of the meaning of
φύσις, and it is, that the search for the primary substance
really was the thing that interested the Ionian
philosophers. Had their main object been, as
Teichmüller held it was, the explanation of celestial
and meteorological phenomena, their researches would
not have been called Περὶ φύσεως ἱστορίη,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> but rather
Περὶ οὐρανοῦ or Περὶ μετεώρων. And this we shall
find confirmed by a study of the way in which Greek
cosmology developed. The growing thought which
may be traced through the successive representatives
of any school is always that which concerns the
primary substance, while the astronomical and other
theories are, in the main, peculiar to the individual
thinkers. Teichmüller undoubtedly did good service
by his protest against the treatment of these theories
as mere isolated curiosities. They form, on the contrary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>coherent systems which must be looked at as
wholes. But it is none the less true that Greek
philosophy began, as it ended, with the search for what
was abiding in the flux of things.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Motion and rest.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='In.8'></a>VIII. But how could this give back to nature the
life of which it had been robbed by advancing knowledge?
Simply by making it possible for the life
that had hitherto been supposed to reside in each
particular thing to be transferred to the one thing
of which all others were passing forms. The very
process of birth, growth, and decay might now be
regarded as the unceasing activity of the one ultimate
reality. Aristotle and his followers expressed this by
saying that the early cosmologists believed in an
“eternal motion,” and in substance this is correct,
though it is not probable that they said anything
about the eternal motion in their writings. It is more
likely that they simply took it for granted. In early
times, it is not movement but rest that has to be
accounted for, and we may be sure that the eternity
of motion was not asserted till it had been denied.
As we shall see, it was Parmenides who first denied
it. The idea of a single ultimate substance, when
thoroughly worked out, seemed to leave no room for
motion; and after the time of Parmenides, we do
find that philosophers were concerned to show how
it began. At first, this would not seem to require
explanation at all.</p>

<p class='c002'>Modern writers sometimes give the name of
Hylozoism to this way of thinking, but the term is
apt to be misleading. It suggests theories which deny
the separate reality of life and spirit, whereas, in the
days of Thales, and even far later, the distinction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>between matter and spirit had not been felt, still less
formulated in such a way that it could be denied.
The uncreated, indestructible reality of which these
early thinkers tell us was a body, or even matter, if we
choose to call it so; but it was not matter in the
sense in which matter is opposed to spirit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The downfall of the primitive view of the world.</div>

<p class='c002'>IX. We have indicated the main characteristics of
the primitive view of the world, and we have sketched
in outline the view which displaced it; we must now
consider the causes which led to the downfall of the
one and the rise of the other. Foremost among these
was undoubtedly the widening of the Greek horizon
occasioned by the great extension of maritime enterprise
which followed the decay of the Phoenician naval
supremacy. The scene of the old stories had, as a
rule, been laid just outside the boundaries of the world
known to the men who believed them. Odysseus does
not meet with Kirke or the Kyklops or the Sirens
in the familiar Aegean, but in regions which lay
beyond the ken of the Greeks at the time the <cite>Odyssey</cite>
was composed. Now, however, the West was beginning
to be familiar too, and the fancy of the Greek
explorers led them to identify the lands which they
discovered with the places which the hero of the
national fairy-tale had come to in his wanderings. It
was soon discovered that the monstrous beings in
question were no longer to be found there, and the
belief grew up that they had never been there at all.
So, too, the Milesians had settled colonies all round the
Euxine. The colonists went out with Ἀργὼ πᾶσι
μέλουσα in their minds; and, at the same time as they
changed the name of the Inhospitable to the Hospitable
Sea, they localised the “far country” (αἶα) of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>primitive tale, and made Jason fetch the Golden Fleece
from Kolchis. Above all, the Phokaians had explored
the Mediterranean as far as the Pillars of Herakles,<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
and the new knowledge that the “endless paths” of
the sea had boundaries must have moved men’s minds
in much the same way as the discovery of America did
in later days. A single example will illustrate the
process which was always going on. According to the
primitive view, the heavens were supported by a giant
called Atlas. No one had ever seen him, though he
was supposed to live in Arkadia. The Phokaian explorers
identified him with a cloud-capped mountain in
Africa, and once they had done this, the old belief was
doomed. It was impossible to go on believing in a
god who was also a mountain, conveniently situated
for the trader to steer by, as he sailed to Tarshish in
quest of silver.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Alleged Oriental origin of philosophy.</div>

<p class='c002'>X. But by far the most important question we have
to face is that of the nature and extent of the influence
exercised by what we call Eastern wisdom on the
Greek mind. It is a common idea even now that the
Greeks in some way derived their philosophy from
Egypt and Babylon, and we must therefore try to
understand as clearly as possible what such a statement
really means. To begin with, we must observe
that no writer of the period during which Greek
philosophy flourished knows anything at all of its
having come from the East. Herodotos would not
have omitted to say so, had he ever heard of it; for it
would have confirmed his own belief in the Egyptian
origin of Greek religion and civilisation.<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Plato, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>had a very great respect for the Egyptians on other
grounds, distinctly implies that they were a businesslike
rather than a philosophical people.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Aristotle
speaks only of the origin of mathematics in Egypt<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> (a
point to which we shall return), though, if he had
known of an Egyptian philosophy, it would have suited
his argument better to mention that. It is not till a
far later date, when Egyptian priests and Alexandrian
Jews began to vie with one another in discovering the
sources of Greek philosophy in their own past, that we
first have definite statements to the effect that it came
from Phoenicia or Egypt. Here, however, we must
carefully note two things. In the first place, the word
“philosophy” had come by that time to include
theology of a more or less mystical type, and was even
applied to various forms of asceticism.<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a> In the second
place, the so-called Egyptian philosophy was only
arrived at by a process of turning primitive myths into
allegories. We are still able to judge Philo’s Old
Testament interpretation for ourselves, and we may be
sure that the Egyptian allegorists were even more
arbitrary; for they had far less promising material to
work on. Nothing can be more savage than the myth
of Isis and Osiris;<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a> yet it is first interpreted according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>to the ideas of later Greek philosophy, and then
declared to be the original source of that philosophy.</p>

<p class='c002'>This method of interpretation may be said to
culminate with the Neopythagorean Noumenios, from
whom it passed to the Christian Apologists. It is
Noumenios who asks, “What is Plato, but Moses speaking
Attic?”<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> It seems likely, indeed, that he was thinking
of certain marked resemblances between Plato’s
<cite>Laws</cite> and the Levitical Code when he said this—resemblances
due to the fact that certain primitive
legal ideas are similarly modified in both; but in any
case Clement and Eusebios give the remark a far wider
application.<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a> At the Renaissance, this absurd farrago
was revived along with everything else, and certain
ideas derived from the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Praeparatio Evangelica</cite></span> continued
for long to colour accepted views on the subject.
Even Cudworth speaks complacently of the ancient
“Moschical or Mosaical philosophy” taught by Thales
and Pythagoras.<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> It is important to realise the true
origin of this deeply-rooted prejudice against the
originality of the Greeks. It does not come from
modern researches into the beliefs of ancient peoples;
for these have disclosed absolutely nothing in the way of
evidence for a Phoenician or Egyptian philosophy. It is
a mere residuum of the Alexandrian passion for allegory.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Of course no one nowadays would rest the case
for the Oriental origin of Greek philosophy on the
evidence of Clement or Eusebios; the favourite
argument in recent times has been the analogy of the
arts and religion. We are seeing more and more, it is
said, that the Greeks derived their art and many of
their religious ideas from the East; and it is urged
that the same will in all probability prove true of their
philosophy. This is a specious argument, but not
in the least conclusive. It ignores altogether the
essential difference in the way these things are transmitted
from people to people. Material civilisation
and the arts may pass easily from one people to
another, though they have not a common language,
and certain simple religious ideas can be conveyed by
ritual better than in any other way. Philosophy, on
the other hand, can only be expressed in abstract
language, and it can only be transmitted by educated
men, whether by means of books or oral teaching.
Now we know of no Greek, in the times we are dealing
with, who knew enough of any Oriental language to
read an Egyptian book or even to listen to the discourse
of an Egyptian priest, and we never hear till
a late date of Oriental teachers who wrote or spoke in
Greek. The Greek traveller in Egypt would no doubt
pick up a few words of Egyptian, and it is certain that
somehow or other the priests could make themselves
understood by the Greeks. They were able to
rebuke Hekataios for his family pride, and Plato
tells a story of the same sort at the beginning of
the <cite>Timaeus</cite>.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> But they must have made use of
interpreters, and it is impossible to conceive of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>philosophical ideas being communicated through an
uneducated dragoman.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>But really it is not worth while to ask whether the
communication of philosophical ideas was possible or
not, till some evidence has been produced that any of
these peoples had a philosophy to communicate. No
such evidence has yet been discovered, and, so far as
we know, the Indians were the only people besides the
Greeks who ever had anything that deserves the name.
No one now will suggest that Greek philosophy came
from India, and indeed everything points to the conclusion
that Indian philosophy came from Greece.
The chronology of Sanskrit literature is an extremely
difficult subject; but, so far as we can see, the great
Indian systems are later in date than the Greek
philosophies which they most nearly resemble. Of
course the mysticism of the Upanishads and of
Buddhism were of native growth and profoundly influenced
philosophy, but they were not themselves
philosophy in any true sense of the word.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Egyptian mathematics.</div>

<p class='c002'>XI. It would, however, be another thing to say that
Greek philosophy originated quite independently of
Oriental influences. The Greeks themselves believed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>their mathematical science to be of Egyptian origin,
and they must also have known something of Babylonian
astronomy. It cannot be an accident that
philosophy originated in Ionia just at the time when
communication with these two countries was easiest,
and it is significant that the very man who was said
to have introduced geometry from Egypt is also regarded
as the first of the philosophers. It thus
becomes very important for us to discover, if we can,
what Egyptian mathematics meant. We shall see
that, even here, the Greeks were really original.</p>

<p class='c002'>There is a papyrus in the Rhind collection at the
British Museum<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a> which gives us an instructive glimpse
of arithmetic and geometry as these sciences were
understood on the banks of the Nile. It is the work
of one Aahmes, and contains rules for calculations both
of an arithmetical and a geometrical character. The
arithmetical problems mostly concern measures of corn
and fruit, and deal particularly with such questions as
the division of a number of measures among a given
number of persons, the number of loaves or jars of beer
that certain measures will yield, and the wages due
to the workmen for a certain piece of work. It
corresponds exactly, in fact, to the description of
Egyptian arithmetic which Plato has given us in the
<cite>Laws</cite>, where he tells us that the children learnt along
with their letters to solve problems in the distribution
of apples and wreaths to greater or smaller numbers of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>people, the pairing of boxers and wrestlers, and so
forth.<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a> This is clearly the origin of the art which the
Greeks called λογιστική, and they certainly borrowed
that from Egypt; but there is not the slightest trace
of what the Greeks called ἀριθμητική, or the scientific
study of numbers.</p>

<p class='c002'>The geometry of the Rhind papyrus is of a similarly
utilitarian character, and Herodotos, who tells us that
Egyptian geometry arose from the necessity of measuring
the land afresh after the inundations, is obviously
far nearer the mark than Aristotle, who says that it
grew out of the leisure enjoyed by the priestly caste.<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
We find, accordingly, that the rules given for calculating
areas are only exact when these are rectangular. As
fields are usually more or less rectangular, this would
be sufficient for practical purposes. The rule for
finding what is called the <em>seqt</em> of a pyramid is, however,
on a rather higher level, as we should expect; for the
angles of the Egyptian pyramids really are equal, and
there must have been some method for obtaining this
result. It comes to this. Given the “length across
the sole of the foot,” that is, the diagonal of the base,
and that of the <em>piremus</em> or “ridge,” to find a number
which represents the ratio between them. This is done
by dividing half the diagonal of the base by the “ridge,”
and it is obvious that such a method might quite well
be discovered empirically. It seems an anachronism
to speak of elementary trigonometry in connexion with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>a rule like this, and there is nothing to suggest that
the Egyptians went any further.<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a> That the Greeks
learnt as much from them, we shall see to be highly
probable, though we shall see also that, from a comparatively
early period, they generalised it so as to
make it of use in measuring the distances of inaccessible
objects, such as ships at sea. It was probably this
generalisation that suggested the idea of a science of
geometry, which was really the creation of the Pythagoreans,
and we can see how far the Greeks soon
surpassed their teachers from a remark of Demokritos
which has been preserved. He says (fr. 299): “I have
listened to many learned men, but no one has yet
surpassed me in the construction of figures out of lines
accompanied by demonstration, not even the Egyptian
<em>harpedonapts</em>, as they call them.”<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a> Now the word
ἁρπεδονάπτης is not Egyptian but Greek. It means
“cord-fastener,”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and it is a striking coincidence that
the oldest Indian geometrical treatise is called the
<em>Çulvasutras</em> or “rules of the cord.” These things point
to the use of the triangle of which the sides are 3, 4, 5,
and which has always a right angle. We know that
this triangle was used from an early date among the
Chinese and the Hindus, who doubtless got it from
Babylon, and we shall see that Thales probably learnt
the use of it in Egypt.<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> There is no reason whatever
for supposing that any of these peoples had in any
degree troubled themselves to give a theoretical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>demonstration of its properties, though Demokritos
would certainly have been able to do so. Finally,
we must note the highly significant fact that all
mathematical terms are of purely Greek origin.<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Babylonian astronomy.</div>

<p class='c002'>XII. The other source from which the Ionians
directly or indirectly derived material for their cosmology
was the Babylonian astronomy. There is no
doubt that the Babylonians from a very early date had
recorded all celestial phenomena like eclipses. They
had also studied the planetary motions, and determined
the signs of the zodiac. Further, they were able to
predict the recurrence of the phenomena they had
observed with considerable accuracy by means of
cycles based on their recorded observations. I can see
no reason for doubting that they had observed the
phenomenon of precession. Indeed, they could hardly
have failed to notice it; for their observations went
back over so many centuries, that it would be quite
appreciable. We know that, at a later date, Ptolemy
estimated the precession of the equinoxes at one degree
in a hundred years, and it is extremely probable that
this is just the Babylonian value. At any rate, it
agrees very well with their division of the celestial
circle into 360 degrees, and made it possible for a
century to be regarded as a day in the “Great Year,”
a conception we shall meet with later on.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>We shall see that Thales probably knew the cycle
which the Babylonians used to predict eclipses (<a href='#sec3'>§ 3</a>);
but it would be a mistake to suppose that the pioneers
of Greek science had any detailed knowledge of the
Babylonian astronomy. It was not till the time
of Plato that even the names of the planets were
known,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> and the recorded observations were only
made available in Alexandrian times. But, even if
they had known these, their originality would remain.
The Babylonians studied and recorded celestial
phenomena for what we call astrological purposes, not
from any scientific interest. There is no evidence at
all that their accumulated observations ever suggested
to them the least dissatisfaction with the primitive
view of the world, or that they attempted to account
for what they saw in any but the crudest way. The
Greeks, on the other hand, with far fewer data to go
upon, made at least three discoveries of capital
importance in the course of two or three generations.
In the first place, they discovered that the earth is a
sphere and does not rest on anything. In the second
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>place, they discovered the true theory of lunar and
solar eclipses; and, in close connexion with this, they
came to see, in the third place, that the earth is not
the centre of our system, but revolves round it like the
other planets. Not very much later, certain Greeks
even took, at least tentatively, the final step of identifying
the centre round which the earth and the planets
revolve with the sun. These discoveries will be discussed
in their proper place; they are only mentioned
here to show the gulf between Greek astronomy and
everything that had preceded it. The Babylonians
had as many thousand years as the Greeks had
centuries to make these discoveries, and it does not
appear that they ever thought of one of them. The
originality of the Greeks cannot be successfully
questioned till it can be shown that the Babylonians
had even an incorrect idea of what we call the solar
system.</p>

<p class='c002'>We may sum up all this by saying that the Greeks
did not borrow either their philosophy or their science
from the East. They did, however, get from Egypt
certain rules of mensuration which, when generalised,
gave birth to geometry; while from Babylon they
learnt that the phenomena of the heavens recur in
cycles with the greatest regularity. This piece of
knowledge undoubtedly had a great deal to do with
the rise of science; for to the Greek it suggested
further questions such as the Babylonian did not
dream of.<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The scientific character of the early Greek cosmology.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><a id='In.13'></a>XIII. It is necessary to say something as to the
scientific worth of the philosophy we are about to
study. We have just seen that the Eastern peoples
were, at the time of which we write, considerably richer
than the Greeks in accumulated facts, though these
facts had certainly not been observed for any scientific
purpose, and their possession never suggested a revision
of the primitive view of the world. The Greeks, however,
saw in them something that could be turned to
account, and they were never as a people slow to act
on the maxim, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Chacun prend son bien partout où il le
trouve</i></span>. The most striking monument of this spirit
which has come down to us is the work of Herodotos;
and the visit of Solon to Croesus which he describes,
however unhistorical it may be, gives a very lively and
faithful picture of it. Croesus tells Solon that he has
heard much of “his wisdom and his wanderings,” and
how, from love of knowledge (φιλοσοφέων), he has
travelled over much land for the purpose of seeing
what was to be seen (θεωρίης εἵνεκεν). The words
θεωρίη, φιλοσοφίη, and ἱστορίη are, in fact, the catchwords
of the time, though they had, we must remember,
a somewhat different meaning from that which they
were afterwards made to bear at Athens.<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a> The idea
that underlies them all may, perhaps, be best rendered
in English by the word <em>Curiosity</em>; and it was just this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>great gift of curiosity, and the desire to see all the
wonderful things—pyramids, inundations, and so forth—that
were to be seen, which enabled the Greeks to pick
up and turn to their own use such scraps of knowledge
as they could come by among the barbarians. No
sooner did a Greek philosopher learn half a dozen
geometrical propositions, and hear that the phenomena
of the heavens recur in cycles, than he set to work to
look for law everywhere in nature, and, with a splendid
audacity, almost amounting to ὕβρις, to construct a
system of the universe. We may smile, if we please, at
the strange medley of childish fancy and true scientific
insight which these Titanic efforts display, and sometimes
we feel disposed to sympathise with the sages of
the day who warned their more daring contemporaries
“to think the thoughts befitting man’s estate” (ἀνθρώπινα
φρονεῖν). But we shall do well to remember at the
same time that even now it is just such hardy anticipations
of experience that make scientific progress possible,
and that nearly every one of the early inquirers whom
we are about to study made some permanent addition
to the store of positive knowledge, besides opening up
new views of the world in every direction.</p>

<p class='c002'>There is no justification either for the idea that
Greek science was built up solely by more or less lucky
guesswork, instead of by observation and experiment.
The nature of our tradition, which mostly consists of
<em>Placita</em>—that is, of what we call “results”—tends, no
doubt, to create this impression. We are seldom told
why any early philosopher held the views he did, and
the appearance of a string of “opinions” suggests
dogmatism. There are, however, certain exceptions to
the general character of the tradition; and we may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>reasonably suppose that, if the later Greeks had been
interested in the matter, there would have been many
more. We shall see that Anaximander made some
remarkable discoveries in marine biology, which the
researches of the nineteenth century have fully confirmed
(<a href='#sec21'>§ 21</a>), and even Xenophanes supported one
of his theories by referring to the fossils and petrifactions
of such widely separated places as Malta, Paros, and
Syracuse (<a href='#sec59'>§ 59</a>). This is enough to show that the
theory, so commonly held by the earlier philosophers,
that the earth had been originally in a moist state, was
not mythological in origin, but was based on, or at
any rate confirmed by, biological and palaeontological
observations of a thoroughly modern and scientific
type. It would surely be absurd to imagine that the
men who could make these observations had not the
curiosity or the ability to make many others of which
the memory is lost. Indeed, the idea that the Greeks
were not observers is almost ludicrously wrong, as is
proved by two simple considerations. The anatomical
accuracy of Greek sculpture bears witness to trained
habits of observation, and those of the highest order,
while the fixing of the seasons by the heliacal rising
and setting of the stars shows a familiarity with
celestial phenomena which is by no means common
at the present day.<a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> We know, then, that the Greeks
could observe well in matters affecting agriculture,
navigation, and the arts, and we know that they were
curious about the world. Is it conceivable that they
did not use their powers of observation to gratify that
curiosity? It is true, of course, that they had not our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>instruments of precision; but a great deal can be
discovered by the help of very simple apparatus. It is
not to be supposed that Anaximander erected his
<em>gnomon</em> merely that the Spartans might know the
seasons.<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Nor is it true that the Greeks made no use of
experiment. The rise of the experimental method
dates from the time when the medical schools began
to influence the development of philosophy, and
accordingly we find that the first recorded experiment
of a modern type is that of Empedokles with the
<em>klepsydra</em>. We have his own account of this (fr. <a href='#Em.100'>100</a>),
and we can see how it brought him to the verge of
anticipating both Harvey and Torricelli. It is once
more inconceivable that an inquisitive people should
have applied the experimental method in a single
case without extending it to the elucidation of other
problems.</p>

<p class='c002'>Of course the great difficulty for us is the geocentric
hypothesis from which science inevitably started, though
only to outgrow it in a surprisingly short time. So
long as the earth is supposed to be in the centre of
the world, meteorology, in the later sense of the word,
is necessarily identified with astronomy. It is difficult
for us to feel at home in this point of view, and indeed
we have no suitable word to express what the Greeks
at first called an οὐρανός. It will be convenient
to use the word “world” for it; but then we must
remember that it does not refer solely, or even chiefly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>to the earth. The later word κόσμος bears witness to
the growth of scientific ideas. It meant at first the
marshalling of an army, and next the ordered constitution
of a state. It was transferred from this to the
world because in early days the regularity and
constancy of human life was far more clearly seen than
the uniformity of nature. Man lived in a charmed
circle of law and custom, but the world around him
still seemed lawless. That, too, is why, when the
regular course of nature was first realised, no better
word for it could be found than δίκη. It is the same
metaphor which still lives on in the expression
“natural law.”<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The science of the sixth century was mainly
concerned, then, with those parts of the world that
are “aloft” (τὰ μετέωρα), and these include, along
with the heavenly bodies, such things as clouds, rainbows,
and lightning. That is how the heavenly bodies
came sometimes to be explained as ignited clouds, an
idea which seems astonishing to us. But we must
bear in mind that science inevitably and rightly began
with the most obvious hypothesis, and that it was
only the thorough working out of this that could show
its inadequacy. It is just because the Greeks were
the first people to take the geocentric hypothesis
seriously that they were able to go beyond it. Of
course the pioneers of Greek thought had no clear idea
of the nature of scientific hypothesis, and supposed
themselves to be dealing with ultimate reality. That
was inevitable before the rise of Logic. At the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>time, a sure instinct guided them to the right method,
and we can see how it was the effort to “save appearances”<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a>
that really operated from the first. It is,
therefore, to those men that we owe the conception of
an exact science which should ultimately take in the
whole world as its object. They fancied—absurdly
enough, no doubt—that they could work out this
science at once. We sometimes make the same mistake
nowadays; and it can no more rob the Greeks of the
honour of having been the first to see the true, though
perhaps unattainable, end of all science than it can rob
our own scientific men of the honour of having brought
that end nearer than it was. It is still knowledge of
the kind foreseen and attempted by the Greeks that
they are in search of.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Schools of philosophy.</div>

<p class='c002'>XIV. Theophrastos, the first writer to treat the
history of Greek philosophy in a systematic way,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
represented the early cosmologists as standing to one
another in the relation of master and scholar, and as
members of regular societies. This has been regarded
by many modern writers as an anachronism, and
some have even denied the existence of “schools” of
philosophy altogether. Such a reaction against the
older view was quite justified in so far as it was directed
against arbitrary classifications like the “Ionic” and
“Italian” schools, which are derived through Laertios
Diogenes from the Alexandrian writers of “Successions.”
But the express statements of Theophrastos are not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to be so lightly set aside. As this point is of great
importance, it will be necessary to elucidate it still
further before we enter upon our story.</p>

<p class='c002'>The modern view really rests upon a mistaken idea
of the way in which civilisation develops. In almost
every department of life, we find that the corporation
at first is everything and the individual nothing. The
peoples of the East hardly got beyond this stage at
all; their science, such as it is, is anonymous, the
inherited property of a caste or guild, and we still see
clearly in some cases that it was once the same among
the Hellenes. Medicine, for instance, was originally the
“mystery” of the Asklepiads, and it is to be supposed
that all craftsmen (δημιουργοί), amongst whom Homer
classes the bards (ἀοιδοί), were at first organised in
a similar way. What distinguished the Hellenes from
other peoples was that at a comparatively early date
these crafts came under the influence of outstanding
individuals, who gave them a fresh direction and a new
impulse. It is doubtless in some such way that we
should understand the relation of Homer to the
Homeridai. The Asklepiads at a later date produced
Hippokrates, and if we knew more of such guilds as the
Daidalids, it is likely we should find something of the
same kind. But this does not destroy the corporate
character of the craft; indeed, it rather intensifies it.
The guild becomes what we call a “school,” and the
disciple takes the place of the apprentice. That is a
vital change. A close guild with none but official
heads is essentially conservative, while a band of
disciples attached to a master they revere is the
greatest progressive force the world knows.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is certain that the later Athenian schools were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>organised corporations, the oldest of which, the
Academy, maintained its existence as such for some
nine hundred years, and the only question we have to
decide is whether this was an innovation made in the
fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, or rather the continuance of an old
tradition. As it happens, we have the authority of
Plato for speaking of the chief early systems as handed
down in schools. He makes Sokrates speak of “the
men of Ephesos,” the Herakleiteans, as forming a
strong body in his own day,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> and the stranger of the
<cite>Sophist</cite> and the <cite>Statesman</cite> speaks of his school
as still in existence at Elea.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a> We also hear of
“Anaxagoreans,”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a> and no one, of course, can doubt
that the Pythagoreans were a society. In fact, there
is hardly any school but that of Miletos for which we
have not external evidence of the strongest kind; and
even as regards it, we have the significant fact that
Theophrastos speaks of philosophers of a later date
as having been “associates of the philosophy of
Anaximenes.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a> We shall see too in the first chapter
that the internal evidence in favour of the existence of
a Milesian school is very strong indeed. It is from
this point of view, then, that we shall now proceed to
consider the men who created Hellenic science.</p>

“ridge.” It is really, however, a Greek word too, and is the name of a kind

kind, and the practice of formulating recurrences in cycles, it is scarcely
conceivable that the Babylonians should not have invented a cycle for
precession. It is equally intelligible that they should only have reached a
rough approximation; for the precessional period is really about 27,600 years
and not 36,000. It is to be observed that Plato’s “perfect year” is also
36,000 solar years (Adam’s <cite>Republic</cite>, vol. ii. p. 302), and that it is probably
connected with the precession of the equinoxes. (Cf. <cite>Tim.</cite> 39 d, a passage
which is most easily interpreted if referred to precession.) This suggestion
as to the origin of the “Great Year” was thrown out by Mr. Adam (<i>op. cit.</i>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I <br /> THE MILESIAN SCHOOL</h2>
</div>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Miletos and Lydia.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec1'></a>1. It was at Miletos that the earliest school of
scientific cosmology had its home. At the time it arose,
the Milesians were in an exceptionally favourable
position for scientific as well as commercial pursuits.
They had, indeed, come into conflict more than once
with the neighbouring Lydians, whose rulers were now
bent upon extending their dominion to the coast; but,
towards the end of the seventh century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, Thrasyboulos,
tyrant of Miletos, had succeeded in making terms
with King Alyattes, and an alliance was concluded
between them, which not only saved Miletos for the
present from a disaster like that which befell Smyrna,
but secured it against molestation for the future.
Even half a century later, when Croesus, resuming his
father’s forward policy, made war upon and conquered
Ephesos, Miletos was still able to maintain the old
treaty-relation, and never, strictly speaking, became
subject to the Lydians at all. We can hardly doubt
that the sense of security which this exceptional position
would foster had something to do with the rise of
scientific inquiry. Material prosperity is necessary as a
foundation for the highest intellectual effort; and at this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>time Miletos was in possession of all the refinements of
life to a degree unknown in continental Hellas.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nor was it only in this way that the Lydian
connexion would favour the growth of science at
Miletos. What was called Hellenism at a later date
seems to have been traditional in the dynasty of the
Mermnadai. There may well be some truth in the
statement of Herodotos, that all the “sophists” of the
time flocked to the court of Sardeis.<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> The tradition
which represents Croesus as what we should call the
“patron” of Greek wisdom, was fully developed in the
fifth century; and, however unhistorical its details may
be, it must clearly have some sort of foundation in
fact. Particularly noteworthy is “the common tale
among the Greeks,” that Thales accompanied him on
his luckless campaign against Pteria, apparently in the
capacity of military engineer. Herodotos, indeed,
disbelieves the story that he diverted the course of
the Halys;<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a> but he does not attack it on the ground
of any antecedent improbability, and it is quite clear
that those who reported it found no difficulty in accepting
the relation which it presupposes between the
philosopher and the king.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>It should be added that the Lydian alliance would
greatly facilitate intercourse with Babylon and Egypt.
Lydia was an advanced post of Babylonian culture,
and Croesus was on friendly terms with the kings of
both Egypt and Babylon. It is noteworthy, too, that
Amasis of Egypt had the same Hellenic sympathies as
Croesus, and that the Milesians possessed a temple of
their own at Naukratis.<a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c018'>I. <span class='sc'>Thales</span></h3>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Origin.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec2'></a>2. There can be no doubt that the founder of the
Milesian school, and therefore the first of the cosmologists,
was Thales;<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> but all we can really be said to
know of him comes from Herodotos, and the romance
of the Seven Wise Men was already in existence when
he wrote. He tells us, in the first place, that Thales
was of Phoenician descent, a statement which other
writers explained by saying he belonged to the Thelidai,
a noble house descended from Kadmos and Agenor.<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a>
This is clearly connected with the view of Herodotos
that there were “Kadmeians” from Boiotia among the
original Ionian colonists, and it is certain that there
really were people called Kadmeians in several Ionic
cities.<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> Whether they were of Semitic origin is, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>course, another matter. Herodotos probably mentions
the supposed descent of Thales simply because he was
believed to have introduced certain improvements in
navigation from Phoenicia.<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> At any rate, the name
Examyes, which his father bore, lends no support to
the view that he was a Semite. It is a Karian name,
and the Karians had been almost completely assimilated
by the Ionians. On the monuments, we find Greek
and Karian names alternating in the same families, and
there is therefore no reason to suppose that Thales was
anything else than an ordinary Milesian citizen, though
perhaps with Karian blood in his veins.<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The eclipse foretold by Thales.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec3'></a>3. By far the most remarkable statement that
Herodotos makes about Thales is that he foretold the
eclipse of the sun which put an end to the war between
the Lydians and the Medes.<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a> Now, we may be sure
that he was quite ignorant of the true cause of eclipses.
Anaximander and his successors certainly were so,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and
it is incredible that the right explanation should once
have been given and then forgotten so soon. Even
supposing, however, Thales had known the cause of
eclipses, no one can believe that such scraps of
elementary geometry as he picked up in Egypt would
enable him to calculate one from the elements of the
moon’s path. Yet the evidence for the prediction is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>too strong to be rejected off-hand. The testimony of
Herodotos to an event which must have happened
about a hundred years before his own birth may,
perhaps, be deemed insufficient; but that of Xenophanes
is a very different matter, and it is this we
have really to deal with.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a> According to Theophrastos,
Xenophanes was a disciple of Anaximander, and he
may quite well have seen and spoken with Thales. In
any case, he must have known scores of people who
were able to remember what happened, and he had no
conceivable interest in misrepresenting it. The prediction
of the eclipse is really better attested than any
other fact about Thales whatsoever, and the evidence
for it is about as strong as for anything that happened
in the early part of the sixth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c002'>Now it is quite possible to predict eclipses without
knowing their true cause, and there is no doubt that
the Babylonians actually did so. On the basis of their
astronomical observations, they had made out a cycle
of 223 lunar months, within which eclipses of the sun
and moon recurred at equal intervals of time.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> This,
it is true, would not enable them to predict eclipses of
the sun for a given spot on the earth’s surface; for
these phenomena are not visible at all places where the
sun is above the horizon at the time. We do not
occupy a position at the centre of the earth, and what
astronomers call the geocentric parallax has to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>taken into account. It would only, therefore, be
possible to tell by means of the cycle that an eclipse
of the sun would be visible somewhere, and that it
might be worth while to look out for it. Now, if we
may judge from a report by a Chaldaean astronomer
which has been preserved, this was just the position of
the Babylonians. They watched for eclipses at the
proper dates; and, if they did not occur, they announced
the fact as a good omen.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a> To explain what we are
told about Thales no more than this is required. He
simply said there would be an eclipse; and, as good
luck would have it, it was visible in Asia Minor, and on
a striking occasion.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Date of Thales.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec4'></a>4. The prediction of the eclipse does not, then, throw
much light upon the scientific attainments of Thales;
but, if we can fix its date, it will give us a point from
which to start in trying to determine the time at which
he lived. Modern astronomers have calculated that
there was an eclipse of the sun, probably visible in
Asia Minor, on May 28 (O.S.), 585 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> while Pliny
gives the date of the eclipse foretold by Thales as Ol.
XLVIII. 4 (585/4 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a> This, it is true, does not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>exactly tally; for May 585 belongs to the year 586/5
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> It is sufficiently near, however, to justify us in
identifying the eclipse as that of Thales, and this is
confirmed by Apollodoros, who fixed his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>floruit</i></span> in the
same year.<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> The further statement that, according to
Demetrios Phalereus, Thales “received the name of
wise” in the archonship of Damasias at Athens, agrees
very well with this, and is doubtless based on the story
of the Delphic tripod; for the archonship of Damasias
is the era of the restoration of the Pythian Games.<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Thales in Egypt.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec5'></a>5. The introduction of Egyptian geometry into
Hellas is universally ascribed to Thales, and it is
extremely probable that he did visit Egypt; for he
had a theory of the inundations of the Nile. In a
well-known passage,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> Herodotos gives three explanations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of the fact that this alone of all rivers rises in
summer and falls in winter; but, as his custom is in
such cases, he does not name their authors. The first
of them, however, that which attributes the floods to
the Etesian winds, is ascribed to Thales in the <cite>Placita</cite>,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
and also by many later writers. Now, those statements
are derived from a treatise on the Rise of the Nile
attributed to Aristotle and known to the Greek
commentators, but now extant only in a Latin epitome
of the thirteenth century.<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a> In this work the first of
the three theories mentioned by Herodotos is ascribed
to Thales, the second to Euthymenes of Massalia, and
the third to Anaxagoras. Where did Aristotle, or
whoever wrote the book, get these names? We think
naturally once more of Hekataios, whom Herodotos so
often reproduces without mentioning his name; and
this conjecture is much strengthened when we find that
Hekataios actually mentioned Euthymenes.<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> We may
conclude, then, that Thales really was in Egypt; and,
perhaps, that Hekataios, in describing the Nile, took
account, as was only natural, of his distinguished
fellow-citizen’s views.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Thales and geometry.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec6'></a>6. As to the nature and extent of the mathematical
knowledge brought back by Thales from Egypt, it
seems desirable to point out that many writers have
seriously misunderstood the character of the tradition.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a>
In his commentary on the First Book of Euclid,
Proclus enumerates, on the authority of Eudemos,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>certain propositions which he says were known to
Thales.<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a> One of the theorems with which he credits
him is that two triangles are equal when they have one
side and the two adjacent angles equal. This he must
have known, said Eudemos, as otherwise he could not
have measured the distances of ships at sea from a
watch-tower in the way he was said to have done.<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
Here we see how all these statements arose. Certain
remarkable feats in the way of measurement were
traditionally ascribed to Thales, and it was assumed
that he must have known all the propositions which
these imply. But this is quite an illusory method of
inference. Both the measurement of the distance of
ships at sea, and that of the height of the pyramids,
which is also ascribed to him,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> are easy applications of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>what Aahmes calls the <em>seqt</em>. These rules of mensuration
may well have been brought from Egypt by
Thales, but we have no ground for supposing that he
knew any more about their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>rationale</i></span> than did the
author of the Rhind papyrus. Perhaps, indeed, he
gave them a wider application than the Egyptians had
done. Still, mathematics, properly so called, did not
come into existence till some time after Thales.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Thales as a politician.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec7'></a>7. Thales appears once more in the pages of
Herodotos some time before the fall of the Lydian
empire. He is said to have urged the Ionian Greeks
to unite in a federal state with its capital at Teos.<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a>
We shall have occasion to notice more than once in
the sequel that the early schools of philosophy were
in the habit of trying to influence the course of
political events; and there are many things, for
instance the part played by Hekataios in the Ionian
revolt, which point to the conclusion that the scientific
men of Miletos took up a very decided position in
the stirring times that followed the death of Thales.
It is this political action which has gained the founder
of the Milesian school his undisputed place among the
Seven Wise Men; and it is owing mainly to his
inclusion among those worthies that the numerous
anecdotes which were told of him in later days attached
themselves to his name.<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Uncertain character of the tradition.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec8'></a>8. If Thales ever wrote anything, it soon was lost,
and the works which were written in his name did
not, as a rule, deceive even the ancients.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a> Aristotle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>professes to know something about the views of Thales;
but he does not pretend to know how they were arrived
at, nor the arguments by which they were supported.
He does, indeed, make certain suggestions, which are
repeated by later writers as statements of fact; but he
himself simply gives them for what they are worth.<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a>
There is another difficulty in connexion with the
tradition. Many a precise-looking statement in the
<cite>Placita</cite> has no other foundation than the habit of
ascribing any doctrine which was, roughly speaking,
characteristic of the whole Ionic “Succession” to
“Thales and his followers,” and so producing the
appearance of a definite statement about Thales. But,
in spite of all this, we need not doubt that Aristotle
was correctly informed with regard to the leading
points. We have seen traces of reference to Thales in
Hekataios, and nothing can be more likely than that
later writers of the school should have quoted the
views of its founder. We may venture, therefore, upon
a conjectural restoration of his cosmology, in which we
shall be guided by what we know for certain of the
subsequent development of the Milesian school; for
we should naturally expect to find its characteristic
doctrines at least foreshadowed in the teaching of its
earliest representative. But all this must be taken for
just what it is worth; speaking strictly, we do not
know anything about the teaching of Thales at all.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Conjectural account of the cosmology of Thales.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec9'></a>9. The statements of Aristotle may be reduced to
three:</p>

<div class='quote'>

  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li>(1) The earth floats on the water.<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' 
    class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a>

    </li>
    <li><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>(2) Water is the material cause<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' 
    class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a> of all things.

    </li>
    <li>(3) All things are full of gods. The magnet is alive; for it has the power of moving 
    iron.<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
    </li>
  </ul>

</div>

<p class='c002'>The first of these statements must be understood in
the light of the second, which is expressed in Aristotelian
terminology, but would undoubtedly mean that Thales
had said water was the fundamental or primary thing,
of which all other things were mere transient forms.
It was, we shall see, just such a primary substance
that the Milesian school as a whole was seeking, and
it is unlikely that the earliest answer to the great
question of the day should have been the comparatively
subtle one given by Anaximander. We are, perhaps,
justified in holding that the greatness of Thales consisted
in this, that he was the first to ask, not what
<em>was</em> the original thing, but what <em>is</em> the primary thing
now; or, more simply still, “What is the world made
of?” The answer he gave to this question was: <em>Water</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Water.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec10'></a>10. Aristotle and Theophratos, followed by Simplicius
and the doxographers, suggest several explanations
of this answer. By Aristotle these explanations
are given as conjectural; it is only later writers that
repeat them as if they were quite certain.<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a> The most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>probable view of them seems to be that Aristotle simply
ascribed to Thales the arguments used at a later date
by Hippon of Samos in support of a similar thesis.<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
This would account for their physiological character.
The rise of scientific medicine had made biological
arguments very popular in the fifth century; but, in the
days of Thales, the prevailing interest was not physiological,
but rather what we should call meteorological,
and it is therefore from this point of view we must try
to understand the theory.</p>

<p class='c002'>Now it is not very hard to see how considerations of
a meteorological kind may have led Thales to adopt
the view he did. Of all the things we know, water
seems to take the most various shapes. It is familiar
to us in a solid, a liquid, and a vaporous form, and so
Thales may well have thought that he saw the world-process
from water and back to water again going on
before his very eyes. The phenomenon of evaporation
naturally suggests everywhere that the fire of the
heavenly bodies is kept up by the moisture which they
draw from the sea. Even at the present day, the
country people speak of the appearance of sunbeams as
“the sun drawing water.” Water comes down again in
the rain; and lastly, so the early cosmologists thought,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>it turns to earth. This seems strange to us, but it may
have seemed natural enough to men who were familiar
with the river of Egypt which had formed the Delta,
and with the torrents of Asia Minor, which bring down
unusually large alluvial deposits. At the present day
the Gulf of Latmos, on which Miletos used to stand, is
completely filled up. Lastly, they thought, earth turns
once more to water—an idea derived from the observation
of dew, night-mists, and subterranean springs.
For these last were not in early times supposed
to have anything at all to do with the rain. The
“waters under the earth” were regarded as an entirely
independent source of moisture.<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec11'></a>11. The third of the statements mentioned above
is supposed by Aristotle himself to imply that Thales
believed in a “soul of the world,” though he is careful
to mark this as no more than an inference.<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a> The
doctrine of the world-soul is then attributed quite
positively to Thales by Aetios, who gives it in the
Stoic phraseology which he found in his immediate
source, and identifies the world-intellect with God.<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
Cicero found a similar account of the matter in the
Epicurean manual which he followed, but he goes a
step further. Eliminating the Stoic pantheism, he
turns the world-intellect into a Platonic <em>demiourgos</em>, and
says that Thales held there was a divine mind which
formed all things out of water.<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a> All this is derived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>from the cautious statement of Aristotle, and can have
no greater authority than its source. We need not enter,
then, upon the old controversy whether Thales was an
atheist or not. It is really irrelevant. If we may
judge from his successors, he may very possibly have
called water divine; but, if he had any religious beliefs
at all, we may be sure they were quite unconnected
with his cosmological theory.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nor must we make too much of the saying itself
that “all things are full of gods.” It is often supposed
to mean that Thales attributed a “plastic life” to
matter, or that he was a “hylozoist.” We have seen
already how misleading this way of speaking is apt to
be,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a> and we shall do well to avoid it. It is not safe to
regard such an apophthegm as evidence for anything;
the chances are that it belongs to Thales as one of the
Seven Wise Men, rather than as founder of the
Milesian school. Further, such sayings are, as a rule,
anonymous to begin with, and are attributed now to
one sage and now to another.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> On the other hand, it
is extremely probable that Thales did say that the
magnet and amber had souls. That is no apophthegm,
but something more on the level of the statement that
the earth floats on the water. It is, in fact, just the
sort of thing we should expect Hekataios to record
about Thales. It would be wrong, however, to draw
any inferences from it as to his view of the world; for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>to say that the magnet and amber are alive is to imply,
if anything, that other things are not.<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c018'>II. <span class='sc'>Anaximander</span></h3>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Life.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec12'></a>12. The next name that has come down to us is
that of Anaximander, son of Praxiades. He too was
a citizen of Miletos, and Theophrastos described him
as an “associate” of Thales.<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a> We have seen how that
expression is to be understood (§ XIV.).</p>

<p class='c002'>According to Apollodoros, Anaximander was sixty-four
years old in Ol. LVIII. 2 (547/6 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>); and this
is confirmed by Hippolytos, who says he was born in
Ol. XLII. 3 (610/9 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), and by Pliny, who assigns
his discovery of the obliquity of the zodiac to the same
Olympiad.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a> We seem to have here something more
than a mere combination of the ordinary type; for,
according to all the rules of Alexandrian chronology,
Anaximander should have “flourished” in 565 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,
that is, just half-way between Thales and Anaximenes,
and this would make him sixty, not sixty-four, in 546.
Now Apollodoros appears to have said that he had
met with the work of Anaximander; and his reason
for mentioning this must be that he found in it some
indication which enabled him to fix its date without
having recourse to conjecture. Diels suggests that
Anaximander may have given his age at the time
of writing as sixty-four, and that the book may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>contained some other statement showing it to have
been published in 547/6 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> Perhaps, however, this
hardly does justice to the fact that the year given is
just that which preceded the fall of Sardeis and the
subjugation of the Lydian empire by the Persians. It
may be a more plausible conjecture that Anaximander,
writing some years later, incidentally mentioned what
his age had been at the time of that great crisis. We
know from Xenophanes that the question, “How old
were you when the Mede appeared?” was considered
an interesting one in those days.<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> At all events, we
seem to be justified in believing that Anaximander was
a generation younger than Thales. When he died we
do not really know.<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Like his predecessor, Anaximander distinguished
himself by certain practical inventions. Some writers
credited him with that of the <em>gnomon</em>; but that can
hardly be correct. Herodotos tells us this instrument
came from Babylon, so perhaps it was Anaximander
who made it known among the Greeks. He was also
the first to construct a map, and Eratosthenes said this
was the map elaborated by Hekataios.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theophrastos on Anaximander’s theory of the primary substance.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span><a id='sec13'></a>13. Nearly all we know of Anaximander’s system
is derived in the last resort from Theophrastos.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a> As
to the credibility of what we are told on his authority,
it is enough to remark that the original work, which
was in the hands of Apollodoros, must certainly have
existed in the time of Theophrastos. Moreover, he
seems once at least to have quoted Anaximander’s own
words, and he criticised his style. Here are the
remains of what he said of him in the First Book:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Anaximander of Miletos, son of Praxiades, a fellow-citizen
and associate of Thales,<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a> said that the material cause and first
element of things was the Infinite, he being the first to introduce
this name for the material cause. He says it is neither
water nor any other of the so-called<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a> elements, but a substance
different from them which is infinite, from which arise all the
heavens and the worlds within them.—<cite>Phys. Op.</cite> fr. 2 (<cite>Dox.</cite>
p. 476; R. P. 16).</p>

<p class='c002'>He says that this is eternal and ageless, and that it encompasses
all the worlds.—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i. 6 (R. P. 17 a).</p>

<p class='c002'>And into that from which things take their rise they pass
away once more, “as is ordained; for they make reparation
and satisfaction to one another for their injustice according
to the appointed time,” as he says<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a> in these somewhat poetical
terms.—<cite>Phys. Op.</cite> fr. 2 (R. P. 16).</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>And besides this, there was an eternal motion, in the course
of which was brought about the origin of the worlds.—Hipp.
<cite>Ref.</cite> i. 6 (R. P. 17 a).</p>

<p class='c002'>He did not ascribe the origin of things to any alteration in
matter, but said that the oppositions in the substratum, which
was a boundless body, were separated out.—Simpl. <cite>Phys.</cite> p.
150, 20 (R. P. 18).</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The primary substance is not one of the “elements.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec14'></a>14. Anaximander taught, then, that there was one
eternal, indestructible substance out of which everything
arises, and into which everything once more returns;
a boundless stock from which the waste of existence is
continually being made good. This is only the natural
development of the thought we have ventured to
ascribe to Thales, and there can be no doubt that
Anaximander at least distinctly formulated it. Indeed,
we can still follow to some extent the reasoning which
led him to do so. Thales had regarded water as the
most likely of all the things we know to be that of
which all others are forms; Anaximander appears to
have asked himself how the primary substance could
be one of these particular things. His argument seems
to be preserved by Aristotle, who has the following
passage in his discussion of the Infinite:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Further, there cannot be a single, simple body which is
infinite, either, as some hold, one distinct from the elements,
which they then derive from it, nor without this qualification.
For there are some who make this (<i>i.e.</i> a body distinct from
the elements) the infinite, and not air or water, in order that
the other things may not be destroyed by their infinity. <em>They
are in opposition one to another</em>—air is cold, water moist, and
fire hot—and therefore, <em>if any one of them were infinite, the
rest would have ceased to be by this time</em>. Accordingly they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>say that what is infinite is something other than the elements,
and from it the elements arise.—Arist. <cite>Phys.</cite> Γ, 5. 204 b 22
(R. P. 16 b).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>It is clear that in this passage Anaximander is contrasted
with Thales and with Anaximenes. Nor is there
any reason to doubt that the account given of his
reasoning is substantially correct, though the form is
Aristotle’s own, and the mention of “elements” is an
anachronism.<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a> Anaximander was struck, it would
seem, by the opposition and strife between the things
which go to make up the world; the warm fire was
opposed to the cold air, the dry earth to the moist sea.
These opposites were at war, and any predominance of
one over the other was an “injustice” for which they
must make reparation to one another.<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a> We may
suppose that his thoughts ran somewhat as follows.
If Thales had been right in saying that water was the
fundamental reality, it would not be easy to see how
anything else could ever have existed. One side of
the opposition, the cold and moist, would have had its
way unchecked, injustice would have prevailed, and the
warm and dry would have been driven from the field
long ago. We must, then, have something which is
not itself one of the warring opposites we know, something
more primitive, out of which they arise, and into
which they once more pass away. That Anaximander
called this something by the name of φύσις, is clear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>from the doxographers; the current statement that the
word ἀρχή in the sense of a “first principle” was introduced
by him, is probably due to a misunderstanding
of what Theophrastos said.<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c014'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Aristotle’s account of the theory.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec15'></a>15. It was natural for Aristotle to regard this
theory as an anticipation or presentiment of his own
doctrine of “indeterminate matter.”<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a> He knew very
well, of course, that he himself was the author of that;
but it is in accordance with his method to represent his
own theories as the distinct formulation of truths which
earlier thinkers had only guessed at. It was to be
expected, then, that he should sometimes express
the views of Anaximander in terms of the theory of
“elements.” He knew too that the Boundless was a
body,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a> though in his own system there was no room
for anything corporeal prior to the elements; so he had
to speak of it as a boundless body “alongside of” or
“distinct from” the elements (παρὰ τὰ στοιχεῖα). So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>far as I know, no one has doubted that, when he uses
this phrase, he is referring to Anaximander.</p>

<p class='c002'>In a number of other places Aristotle speaks of a
thinker, whom he does not happen to name, who held
that the primary substance was something “intermediate
between” the elements or between two of them.<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a>
Nearly all the Greek commentators referred this to
Anaximander also, but most modern writers refuse to
follow them. It is, no doubt, easy to show that
Anaximander can have never meant to describe the
Boundless in this way, but that is no real objection to the
older interpretation. It is difficult to see that it is more
of an anachronism to call the Boundless “intermediate
between the elements” than to say that it is “distinct
from the elements”; and indeed, if once we introduce
the elements at all, the former description is in some
ways the more adequate of the two. At any rate, if
we refuse to understand these passages as referring to
Anaximander, we shall have to say that Aristotle
paid a great deal of attention to some early thinker,
whose very name has been lost, and who not only
agreed with some of Anaximander’s views, but also,
as is shown by one passage, used some of his most
characteristic expressions.<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a> We may add that in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>or two places Aristotle certainly seems to identify the
“intermediate” with the something “distinct from” the
elements.<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>There is even one place in which he appears to
speak of Anaximander’s Boundless as a “mixture,”
though his words may perhaps admit of another interpretation.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a>
But this is of no consequence for our
interpretation of Anaximander himself. It is certain
that he cannot have said anything about “elements,”
which no one thought of before Empedokles, and no
one could think of before Parmenides. The question
has only been mentioned at all because it has been
the subject of a lengthy controversy,<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a> and because
it throws great light on the historical value of Aristotle’s
statements. From the point of view of his own system,
these are abundantly justified; but we shall have to
remember in other cases that, when he seems to attribute
an idea to some earlier thinker, we are not in the least
bound to believe what he says in a historical sense.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The primary substance is infinite.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec16'></a>16. Anaximander’s reason for conceiving the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>primary substance as boundless was, no doubt, that
indicated by Aristotle, namely, “that becoming might
not fail.”<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a> It is not likely, however, that these words
are his own, though the doxographers speak as if they
were. It is enough for us to know that Theophrastos,
who had seen his book, attributed the thought to him.
And certainly the way in which he regarded the world
would bring home to him with more than common
force the need of a boundless stock of matter. The
“opposites” of which our world consists are, we have
seen, at war with one another, and their strife is marked
by “unjust” encroachments on either side. The warm
commits “injustice” in summer, the cold in winter.
To redress the balance, they must be absorbed once
more in their common ground; and this would lead
in the long run to the destruction of everything but
the Boundless itself, if there were not an inexhaustible
supply of it from which opposites might continually
be separated out afresh. We must picture to ourselves,
then, an endless mass, which is not any one of the
opposites we know, stretching out without limit on
every side of the heavens which bound the world we
live in.<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a> This mass is a body, and out of it our world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>once emerged by the “separating out” of the opposites,
which one day will all be absorbed again in the Boundless,
and our world will cease to be.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The eternal motion.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec17'></a>17. The doxographers say it was the “eternal
motion” that brought into being “all the heavens and all
the worlds within them.” As we have seen (<a href='#In.8'>§ VIII</a>),
it is not likely that Anaximander himself used the
phrase “eternal motion.” That is rather Aristotle’s own
version of what he found stated about the “separating
out” of opposites. We are not told expressly how
Anaximander conceived this to operate, but the term
“separating out” suggests some process of shaking and
sifting as in a sieve. Now it is just such a process that
Plato makes the Pythagorean Timaios describe, and the
most probable theory is certainly that here, as in many
other cases, he has reproduced a genuinely early view.
As we shall see, it is quite likely that the Pythagoreans
should have followed Anaximander in this.<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a> In
any case, it is wrong to identify the “eternal motion”
with the diurnal revolution of the heavens, as has
sometimes been done. That motion cannot possibly
be eternal, for the simple reason that the heavens
themselves are perishable. Aristotle says, indeed, that
all who believe the world has come into being represent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the earth as having been forced into the centre by the
circular motion;<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c014'><sup>[116]</sup></a> but, though this doubtless refers to
Anaximander among others, it is quite irrelevant here.
It has to do only with the formation of the world after
it has been once for all separated off and enclosed in its
own heaven, and we shall have to remember it when
we come to that part of the theory. At present, we
have only to do with the motion of the Boundless
itself; and, if we wish to picture that, it is much safer
to regard it as a sort of shaking up and down which
sorts out the opposites from the infinite mass.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The innumerable worlds.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec18'></a>18. We are told more than once that Anaximander
believed there were “innumerable worlds in the Boundless,”<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
and it is now usual to regard these with Zeller
as an infinite series succeeding one another in time.
It may be allowed at once that his disproof of the idea
that the worlds are coexistent and eternal is decisive.
To suppose that Anaximander regarded this or any
other world as eternal, is a flat contradiction of everything
we otherwise know, and of the Theophrastean
tradition that he taught the world was perishable. We
have, then, to decide between the view that, though all
the worlds are perishable, there may be an unlimited
number of them in existence at the same time, and the
view that a new world never comes into existence till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the old one has passed away. Now, Zeller allows<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a> that
there is nothing in the first of these views that is
inconsistent with what we know of Anaximander; but
he thinks all the statements which have come down to
us point rather to the second. It seems to me that
this is by no means the case, and, as the matter is
of fundamental importance, it will be necessary to
examine the evidence once more.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the first place, the doxographical tradition proves
that Theophrastos discussed the views of all the early
philosophers as to whether there was one world or an
infinite number, and there can be no doubt that, when
he ascribed “innumerable worlds” to the Atomists,
he meant coexistent and not successive worlds. Now,
if he had really classed two such different views under
one head, he would at least have been careful to point
out in what respect they differed, and there is no trace of
any such distinction in our tradition. On the contrary,
Anaximander, Anaximenes, Archelaos, Xenophanes,
Diogenes, Leukippos, Demokritos, and Epicurus are
all mentioned together as holding the doctrine of
“innumerable worlds” on all sides of this one,<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> and the
only distinction drawn between their views is that,
while Epicurus made the distances between these
worlds unequal, Anaximander said all the worlds were
equidistant.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a> Zeller rejected this evidence, which he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>supposed to be merely that of Stobaios, on the
ground that we can have no confidence in a writer
who attributes “innumerable worlds” to Anaximenes,
Archelaos, and Xenophanes. With regard to the first
two, I hope to show that the statement is quite correct,
and that it is not even incorrect in the case of the last.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a>
In any case, it can be proved that the passage comes
from Aetios,<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a> and there is no reason for doubting that,
in the last resort, it is derived from Theophrastos,
though the name of Epicurus may have been added
later. This is still further confirmed by what Simplicius
says in his commentary on the <cite>Physics</cite>.<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a></p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Those who assumed innumerable worlds, <i>e.g.</i> Anaximander,
Leukippos, Demokritos, and, at a later date, Epicurus, held
that they came into being and passed away <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad infinitum</i></span>, some
always coming into being and others passing away.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>It is probable that this too comes from Theophrastos
through Alexander. Simplicius does not invent such
things.</p>

<p class='c002'>We come lastly to a very important statement
which Cicero has copied from Philodemos, the author
of the Epicurean treatise on Religion found at
Herculaneum, or perhaps from the immediate source
of that work. “Anaximander’s opinion was,” he makes
Velleius say, “that there were gods who came into
being, rising and passing away at long intervals, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>that these were the innumerable worlds”;<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a> and this
must clearly be taken along with the statement of
Aetios to the effect that, according to Anaximander,
the “innumerable heavens” were gods.<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a> Now it is very
much more natural to understand the “long intervals”
which Cicero mentions as intervals of space than as intervals
of time;<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a> and, if we take the passage in this way,
we have a perfect agreement among all our authorities.</p>

<p class='c002'>It may be added that it is very unnatural to understand
the statement that the Boundless “encompasses
all the worlds” of worlds succeeding one another in
time; for on this view there is at a given time only
one world to “encompass.” Moreover, the argument
mentioned by Aristotle that, if what is outside the
heavens is infinite, body must be infinite, and there
must be innumerable worlds, can only be understood
in this sense, and is certainly intended to represent
the reasoning of the Milesians; for they were the only
cosmologists who held there was a boundless body
outside the heavens.<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a> Lastly, we happen to know that
Petron, one of the earliest Pythagoreans, held there
were just one hundred and eighty-three worlds arranged
in a triangle,<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a> which shows that views of this sort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>existed long before the Atomists, and looks like an
attempt to introduce some order into Anaximander’s
universe.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Origin of the heavenly bodies.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec19'></a>19. The doxographers have not left us in the dark
as to the process by which the different parts of the
world arose from the Boundless. The following statement
comes ultimately from Theophrastos:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>He says that something capable of begetting hot and cold
was separated off from the eternal at the origin of this world.
From this arose a sphere of flame which grew round the air
encircling the earth, as the bark grows round a tree. When
this was torn off and enclosed in certain rings, the sun, moon,
and stars came into existence.—Ps.-Plut. <cite>Strom.</cite> fr. 2
(R. P. 19).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>We see from this that when a portion of the Boundless
had been separated off from the rest to form a
world, it first of all differentiated itself into the two
opposites, hot and cold. The hot appears as a sphere
of flame surrounding the cold; the cold, as earth with
air surrounding it. We are not told, however, in this
extract how the cold came to be differentiated into
earth, air, and water; but there is a passage in
Aristotle’s <cite>Meteorology</cite> which throws some light on
the subject. We read there:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>But those who are wiser in the wisdom of men give an
origin for the sea. At first, they say, all the terrestrial region
was moist; and, as it was dried up by the sun, the portion of
it that evaporated produced the winds and the turnings of the
sun and moon, while the portion left behind was the sea. So
they think the sea is becoming smaller by being dried up,
and that at last it will all be dry.—<cite>Meteor.</cite> Β, 1. 353 b 5.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c002'>And the same absurdity arises for those who say that the
earth and the terrestrial part of the world at first were moist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>but that air arose from the heat of the sun, and that the
whole world was thus increased, and that this is the cause of
winds and the turnings of the heavens.<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a>—<i>Ib.</i> 2. 355 a 21
(R. P. 20 a).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>In his commentary on the passage, Alexander tells
us that this was the view of Anaximander and
Diogenes; and what he says is amply confirmed by
Anaximander’s theory of the sea as it is given by the
doxographers (<a href='#sec20'>§ 20</a>). We conclude, then, that after
the first separation of the hot and the cold, the heat of
the sphere of flame turned part of the moist, cold
interior of the world into air or vapour—it is all one
at this date—and that the expansion of this mist
broke up the sphere of flame itself into rings. I give
the theory which he adopted to explain the origin of
the heavenly bodies from these rings as it has been
preserved by Hippolytos, with some supplements from
Aetios:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>The heavenly bodies are wheels of fire separated off from
the fire which encircles the world, and enclosed in air. And
they have breathing-holes, certain pipe-like passages at which
the heavenly bodies are seen. For this reason, too, when the
breathing-holes are stopped, eclipses occur. And the moon
appears now to wax and now to wane because of the stopping
and opening of the passages. The circle of the sun is
twenty-seven times the size (of the earth, while that) of the
moon is eighteen times as large.<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a> The sun is highest of all,
and lowest are the wheels of the fixed stars.—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i.

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Anaximander said the stars were hoop-like compressions of
air, full of fire, breathing out flames at a certain point from
orifices. The sun was highest of all, after it came the moon,
and below these the fixed stars and the planets.—Aetios, ii.
13, 7; 15, 6 (R. P. 19 a).</p>

<p class='c002'>Anaximander said the sun was a ring twenty-eight times
the size of the earth, like a cart-wheel with the felloe hollow
and full of fire, showing the fire at a certain point, as if
through the nozzle of a pair of bellows.—Aet. ii. 20, 1
(R. P. 19 a).</p>

<p class='c002'>Anaximander said the sun was equal to the earth, but the
ring from which it breathes out and by which it is carried round
was twenty-seven times as large as the earth.—Aet. ii. 21, 1
(<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 351).</p>

<p class='c002'>Anaximander said the moon was a ring eighteen times the
size of the earth....—Aet. ii. 25, 1 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 355).<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Anaximander held that thunder and lightning were caused
by the blast. When it is shut up in a thick cloud and bursts
forth with violence, then the breakage of the cloud makes the
noise, and the rift gives the appearance of a flash by contrast
with the darkness of the cloud.—Aet. iii. 3, 1 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 367).</p>

<p class='c002'>Anaximander held that wind was a current of air (<cite>i.e.</cite>
vapour) which arose when its finest and moistest particles were
set in motion or dissolved by the sun.—Aet. iii. 6, 1 (<cite>Dox.</cite>
p. 374).</p>

<p class='c002'>Rain was produced by the moisture drawn up from the
earth by the sun.—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i. 6, 7 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 560).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>We saw above that the sphere of flame was broken
up into rings by the expansion of the air or vapour
that its own heat had drawn up from the moist, cold
interior. We must remember that Anaximander knew
nothing of the ring of Saturn. There are three of
these rings, that of the sun, that of the moon, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>lastly, nearest to the earth, the circle of the stars.
The circle of the sun was twenty-seven times, and that
of the moon eighteen times as large as the earth, from
which we may perhaps infer that the circle of the stars
was nine times as large. The numbers nine, eighteen,
twenty-seven, play a considerable part in primitive
cosmogonies.<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a> We do not see the rings of fire as
complete circles; for the mist that formed them
encloses the fire, and becomes an outer ring of opaque
vapour. These outer rings, however, have openings at
one point of their circumference, through which the
fire escapes, and these are the heavenly bodies we
actually see.<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It will be observed that we only hear of three
circles, and that the circle of the sun is the highest.
The circle of the stars presents some difficulty. It is,
in all probability, the Milky Way, the appearance of
which may well have suggested the whole theory.<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a> It
seems that Anaximander must have thought it had
more “breathing-holes” than one, though the tradition
is silent on this point. There is not the slightest
reason for supposing that he regarded it as a sphere.
He could not have failed to see that a sphere so
placed would make the sun and moon permanently
invisible. What, then, are we to say of the fixed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>stars that do not lie in the Milky Way? There seems
to be no way of accounting for them unless we assume
that they are the “innumerable worlds” which we
have just discussed. As the fire and air which
surrounded the world have been broken up into rings,
we must be able to see right out into the Boundless,
and the fixed stars must be just the worlds, each
surrounded by its fiery envelope. It does not seem
possible to explain all we are told in any other way;
and, if this is right, the statement of some authors,
that Anaximander regarded the stars of heaven as gods,
may be more than the mere mistake which it is now
generally taken to be.<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The explanation given of thunder and lightning
was very similar. They too were caused by fire
breaking through compressed air, that is to say, through
the storm-clouds. It seems probable that this is really
the origin of the theory, and that Anaximander
explained the heavenly bodies on the analogy of
lightning, not <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>. That would be in perfect
agreement with the meteorological interest of the time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Earth and sea.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec20'></a>20. We turn now to what we are told of the origin
of earth and sea from the moist, cold matter which
was “separated off” in the beginning, and which filled
the inside of the sphere of flame:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>The sea is what is left of the original moisture. The fire
has dried up most of it and turned the rest salt by scorching
it.—Aet. iii. 16, 1 (R. P. 20 a).</p>

<p class='c002'>He says that the earth is cylindrical in form, and that its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>depth is as a third part of its. breadth.—Ps.-Plut. <cite>Strom.</cite> fr. 2
(R. P. <i>ib.</i>).</p>

<p class='c002'>The earth swings free, held in its place by nothing. It
stays where it is because of its equal distance from everything.
Its shape is convex and round, and like a stone pillar. We
are on one of the surfaces, and the other is on the opposite
side.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a>—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i. 6 (R. P. 20).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>Adopting for a moment the later theory of
“elements,” we see that Anaximander put fire on one
side as “the hot,” and all the rest on the other as “the
cold,” which is also moist. This may explain how
Aristotle came to speak of the Boundless as intermediate
between fire and water. And we have seen
also that the moist element was partly turned into “air”
or vapour by the fire, which explains how he could say
the Boundless was something between fire and air, or
between air and water.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The moist, cold interior of the world is not, it will
be noticed, pure water. It is always called “the moist”
or “the moist state.” That is because it has to be still
further differentiated under the influence of heat into
earth, water, and vapour. The gradual drying up of
the water by the fire is a good example of what Anaximander
meant by “injustice.” And we see how this
injustice brings about the destruction of the world.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The fire will in time dry up and burn up the whole of
the cold, moist element. But then it will not be fire
any longer; it will simply be the “mixture,” if we
choose to call it so, of the hot and cold—that is, it will
be the same as the Boundless which surrounds it, and
will pass away into it.</p>

<p class='c002'>The view which Anaximander takes of the earth is
a great advance upon anything we can reasonably
attribute to Thales, and Aristotle has preserved the
arguments by which he supported it. It is equally
distant from the extremes in every direction, and there
is no reason for it to move up or down or sideways.<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a>
Still, he does not attain to the idea that it is spherical.
He believes that we live on a convex disc, and from
this the cylindrical form follows as a matter of course.
The really remarkable thing is that he should have
seen, however dimly, that there is no absolute up and
down in the world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Animals.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec21'></a>21. We have seen enough to show us that the
speculations of Anaximander about the world were of
an extremely daring character; we come now to the
crowning audacity of all, his theory of the origin of
living creatures. The Theophrastean account of this
has been well preserved by the doxographers:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Living creatures arose from the moist element as it was
evaporated by the sun. Man was like another animal, namely,
a fish, in the beginning.—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i. 6 (R. P. 22 a).</p>

<p class='c002'>The first animals were produced in the moisture, each enclosed
in a prickly bark. As they advanced in age, they came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>out upon the drier part. When the bark broke off,<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a> they
survived for a short time.—Aet. v. 19, 1 (R. P. 22).</p>

<p class='c002'>Further, he says that originally man was born from animals
of another species. His reason is that while other animals
quickly find food by themselves, man alone requires a lengthy
period of suckling. Hence, had he been originally as he is
now, he would never have survived.—Ps.-Plut. <cite>Strom.</cite> fr. 2
(R. P. <i>ib.</i>).</p>

<p class='c002'>He declares that at first human beings arose in the inside
of fishes, and after having been reared like sharks,<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c014'><sup>[140]</sup></a> and
become capable of protecting themselves, they were finally
cast ashore and took to land.—Plut. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Symp. Quaest.</cite></span> 730 f
(R. P. <i>ib.</i>).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>The importance of these statements has sometimes
been overrated and still more often underestimated.
Anaximander has been called a precursor of Darwin by
some, while others have treated the whole thing as a
mythological survival. It is therefore important to
notice that this is one of the rare cases where we have
not merely a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>placitum</i></span>, but an indication, meagre
though it be, of the observations on which it was based,
and the line of argument by which it was supported.
It is clear from this that Anaximander had an idea of
what is meant by adaptation to environment and
survival of the fittest, and that he saw the higher
mammals could not represent the original type of
animal. For this he looked to the sea, and he naturally
fixed upon those fishes which present the closest
analogy to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mammalia</i></span>. The statements of Aristotle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>about the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>galeus levis</i></span> were shown long ago by Johannes
Müller to be more accurate than those of later
naturalists, and we now know that these observations
were already made by Anaximander. The manner in
which the shark nourishes its young furnished him with
the very thing he required to explain the survival of
the earliest animals.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c014'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec22'></a>22. In the course of our discussion of the “innumerable
worlds” we saw that Anaximander regarded
these as gods. It is true, of course, as Zeller says,<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c014'><sup>[142]</sup></a> that
to the Greeks the word θεός meant primarily an object
of worship, and he rightly adds that no one would think
of worshipping innumerable worlds. This, however, is
no real objection to our interpretation, though it serves
to bring out an interesting point in the development
of Greek theological ideas. The philosophers, in fact,
departed altogether from the received usage of the
word θεός. Empedokles called the Sphere and the
Elements gods, though it is not to be supposed that he
regarded them as objects of worship, and in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>way we shall find that Diogenes of Apollonia spoke of
Air as a god.<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c014'><sup>[143]</sup></a> As we may learn from the <cite>Clouds</cite> of
Aristophanes, it was just this way of speaking that got
philosophers the name of being ἄθεοι. It is of great
importance to bear this point in mind; for, when we
come to Xenophanes, we shall see that the god or gods
he spoke of meant just the world or worlds. It seems
also that Anaximander called the Boundless itself
divine,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a> which is quite in accordance with the language
of Empedokles and Diogenes referred to above.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>III. <span class='sc'>Anaximenes</span></h3>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Life.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec23'></a>23. Anaximenes of Miletos, son of Eurystratos, was,
according to <a id='corr75.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Theophratos'>Theophrastos</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_75.13'><ins class='correction' title='Theophratos'>Theophrastos</ins></a></span>, an “associate” of Anaximander.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a>
Apollodoros said, it appears, that he
“flourished” about the time of the fall of Sardeis
(546/5 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), and died in Ol. LXIII. (528/524 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c014'><sup>[146]</sup></a>
In other words, he was born when Thales “flourished,”
and “flourished” when Thales died, and this means
that Apollodoros had no definite information about his
date at all. He most probably made him die in the
sixty-third Olympiad because that gives just a hundred
years, or three generations, for the Milesian school from
the birth of Thales. We cannot, therefore, say anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>positive as to his date, except that he must have
been younger than Anaximander, and must have
flourished before 494 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, when the school was, of
course, broken up by the destruction of Miletos.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>His book.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec24'></a>24. Anaximenes wrote a book which certainly survived
until the age of literary criticism; for we are told
that he used a simple and unpretentious Ionic,<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a> very
different, we may suppose, from the poetical prose of
Anaximander.<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a> We may probably trust this criticism,
which comes ultimately from Theophrastos; and it
furnishes a good illustration of the truth that the
character of a man’s thoughts is sure to find expression
in his style. We have seen that the speculations of
Anaximander were distinguished for their hardihood
and breadth; those of Anaximenes are marked by just
the opposite quality. He appears to have thought out
his system carefully, but he rejects the more audacious
theories of his predecessor. The result is that, while
his view of the world is on the whole much less like
the truth than Anaximander’s, it is more fruitful in
ideas that were destined to hold their ground.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theory of the primary substance.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec25'></a>25. Anaximenes is one of the philosophers on whom
Theophrastos wrote a special monograph;<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c014'><sup>[149]</sup></a> and this
gives us an additional guarantee for the trustworthiness
of the tradition derived from his great work. The
following<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c014'><sup>[150]</sup></a> are the passages which seem to contain the
fullest and most accurate account of what he had to
say on the central feature of the system:—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Anaximenes of Miletos, son of Eurystratos, who had been
an associate of Anaximander, said, like him, that the underlying
substance was one and infinite. He did not, however,
say it was indeterminate, like Anaximander, but determinate;
for he said it was Air.—<cite>Phys. Op.</cite> fr. 2 (R. P. 26).</p>

<p class='c002'>From it, he said, the things that are, and have been, and
shall be, the gods and things divine, took their rise, while
other things come from its offspring.—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i. 7
(R. P. 28).</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just as,” he said, “our soul, being air, holds us together,
so do breath and air encompass the whole world.”—Aet. i. 3,
4 (R. P. 24).</p>

<p class='c002'>And the form of the air is as follows. Where it is most
even, it is invisible to our sight; but cold and heat, moisture
and motion, make it visible. It is always in motion; for, if
it were not, it would not change so much as it does.—Hipp.
<cite>Ref.</cite> i. 7 (R. P. 28).</p>

<p class='c002'>It differs in different substances in virtue of its rarefaction
and condensation.—<cite>Phys. Op.</cite> fr. 2 (R. P. 26).</p>

<p class='c002'>When it is dilated so as to be rarer, it becomes fire; while
winds, on the other hand, are condensed Air. Cloud is formed
from Air by felting;<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c014'><sup>[151]</sup></a> and this, still further condensed,
becomes water. Water, condensed still more, turns to earth;
and when condensed as much as it can be, to stones.—Hipp.
<cite>Ref.</cite> i. 7 (R. P. 28).<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c014'><sup>[152]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Rarefaction and condensation.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec26'></a>26. At the first glance, this undoubtedly looks like
a falling off from the more refined doctrine of Anaximander
to a cruder view; but a moment’s reflexion will
show that this is not altogether the case. On the
contrary, the introduction of rarefaction and condensation
into the theory is a notable advance.<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c014'><sup>[153]</sup></a> In fact, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>makes the Milesian cosmology thoroughly consistent
for the first time; since it is clear that a theory which
explains everything by the transformations of a single
substance is bound to regard all differences as purely
quantitative. The infinite substance of Anaximander,
from which the opposites “in it” are “separated out,”
cannot, strictly speaking, be thought of as homogeneous,
and the only way to save the unity of the primary
substance is to say that all diversities are due to the
presence of more or less of it in a given space. And
when once this important step has been taken, it is no
longer necessary to make the primary substance something
“distinct from the elements,” to use Aristotle’s
inaccurate but convenient phrase; it may just as well
be one of them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Air.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec27'></a>27. The air that Anaximenes speaks of includes a
good deal that we should not call by that name. In
its normal condition, when most evenly distributed, it is
invisible, and it then corresponds to our “air”; it is
identical with the breath we inhale and the wind that
blows. That is why he called it πνεῦμα. On the
other hand, the old idea, familiar to us in Homer, that
mist or vapour is condensed air, is still accepted without
question. In other words, we may say that Anaximenes
supposed it to be a good deal easier to get liquid
air than it has since proved to be. It was Empedokles,
we shall see, who first discovered that what we call air
was a distinct corporeal substance, and was not identical
either with vapour or with empty space. In the earlier
cosmologists “air” is always a form of vapour, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>even darkness is a form of it. It was Empedokles who
cleared up this point too by showing that darkness is a
shadow.<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c014'><sup>[154]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It was natural for Anaximenes to fix upon Air in
this sense as the primary substance; for, in the system
of Anaximander, it occupied an intermediate place
between the two fundamental opposites, the sphere of
flame and the cold, moist mass within it (<a href='#sec19'>§ 19</a>). We
know from Plutarch that he fancied air became warmer
when rarefied, and colder when condensed. Of this
he satisfied himself by a curious experimental proof.
When we breathe with our mouths open, the air is
warm; when we breathe with our lips closed, it
is cold.<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c014'><sup>[155]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The world breathes.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec28'></a>28. This argument from human breathing brings us
to an important point in the theory of Anaximenes,
which is attested by the single fragment that has come
down to us.<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c014'><sup>[156]</sup></a> “Just as our soul, being air, holds us
together, so do breath and air encompass the whole
world.” The primary substance bears the same relation
to the life of the world as to that of man. Now this,
we shall see, was the Pythagorean view;<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c014'><sup>[157]</sup></a> and it is also
an early instance of the argument from the microcosm
to the macrocosm, and so marks the first beginnings of
an interest in physiological matters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The parts of the world.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span><a id='sec29'></a>29. We turn now to the doxographical tradition
concerning the formation of the world and its parts:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>He says that, as the air was felted, the earth first came
into being. It is very broad and is accordingly supported by
the air.—Ps.-Plut. <cite>Strom.</cite> fr. 3 (R. P. 25).</p>

<p class='c002'>In the same way the sun and the moon and the other
heavenly bodies, which are of a fiery nature, are supported by
the air because of their breadth. The heavenly bodies were
produced from the earth by moisture rising from it. When
this is rarefied, fire comes into being, and the stars are composed
of the fire thus raised aloft. There were also bodies of
earthy substance in the region of the stars, revolving along
with them. And he says that the heavenly bodies do not move
under the earth, as others suppose, but round it, as a cap turns
round our head. The sun is hidden from sight, not because it
goes under the earth, but because it is concealed by the higher
parts of the earth, and because its distance from us becomes
greater. The stars give no heat because of the greatness of
their distance.—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i. 7, 4-6 (R. P. 28).</p>

<p class='c002'>Winds are produced when air is condensed and rushes
along under propulsion; but when it is concentrated and
thickened still more, clouds are generated; and, lastly, it turns
to water.<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c014'><sup>[158]</sup></a>—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i. 7, 7 (Dox. p. 561).</p>

<p class='c002'>The stars are fixed like nails in the crystalline vault of the
heavens.—Aet. ii. 14, 3 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 344).</p>

<p class='c002'>They do not go under the earth, but turn round it.—<i>Ib.</i>
16, 6 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 346).</p>

<p class='c002'>The sun is fiery.—<i>Ib.</i> 20, 2 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 348).</p>

<p class='c002'>It is broad like a leaf.—<i>Ib.</i> 22, 1 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 352).</p>

<p class='c002'>The heavenly bodies are diverted from their courses by the
resistance of compressed air.—<i>Ib.</i> 23, 1 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 352).</p>

<p class='c002'>The moon is of fire.—<i>Ib.</i> 25, 2 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 356).</p>

<p class='c002'>Anaximenes explained lightning like Anaximander, adding
as an illustration what happens in the case of the sea, which
flashes when divided by the oars.—<i>Ib.</i> iii. 3, 2 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 368).</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Hail is produced when water freezes in falling; snow,
when there is some air imprisoned in the water.—Aet. iii 4, 1
(<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 370).</p>

<p class='c002'>The rainbow is produced when the beams of the sun fall on
thick condensed air. Hence the anterior part of it seems red,
being burnt by the sun’s rays, while the other part is dark,
owing to the predominance of moisture. And he says that a

</div>

<p class='c002'>We have seen that Anaximenes was quite justified in
going back to Thales in regard to his general theory of
the primary substance; but it cannot be denied that
the effect of this upon the details of his cosmology was
unfortunate. The earth is once more imagined as a
table-like disc floating upon the air. The sun, moon,
and planets are also fiery discs which float on the air
“like leaves.” It follows that the heavenly bodies
cannot be thought of as going under the earth at night,
but only as going round it laterally like a cap or a
millstone.<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c014'><sup>[160]</sup></a> This curious view is also mentioned in
Aristotle’s <cite>Meteorology</cite>,<a id='r161' /><a href='#f161' class='c014'><sup>[161]</sup></a> where the elevation of the
northern parts of the earth, which makes it possible for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the heavenly bodies to be hidden from sight, is referred
to. In fact, whereas Anaximander had regarded the
orbits of the sun, moon, and stars as oblique with
reference to the earth, Anaximenes regarded the earth
itself as inclined. The only real advance is the
distinction of the planets, which float freely in the
air, from the fixed stars, which are fastened to the
“crystalline” vault of the sky.<a id='r162' /><a href='#f162' class='c014'><sup>[162]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The earthy bodies, which circulate among the
planets, are doubtless intended to account for eclipses
and the phases of the moon.<a id='r163' /><a href='#f163' class='c014'><sup>[163]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innumerable worlds.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec30'></a>30. As might be expected, there is the same
difficulty about the “innumerable worlds” ascribed to
Anaximenes as about those of Anaximander, and most
of the arguments given above (<a href='#sec18'>§ 18</a>) apply here also.
The evidence, however, is far less satisfactory. Cicero
says that Anaximenes regarded air as a god, and adds
that it came into being.<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c014'><sup>[164]</sup></a> That there is some confusion
here is obvious. Air, as the primary substance, is
certainly eternal, and it is quite likely that Anaximenes
called it “divine,” as Anaximander did the Boundless;
but it is certain that he also spoke of gods who came
into being and passed away. These arose, he said, from
the air. This is expressly stated by Hippolytos,<a id='r165' /><a href='#f165' class='c014'><sup>[165]</sup></a> and
also by St. Augustine.<a id='r166' /><a href='#f166' class='c014'><sup>[166]</sup></a> These gods are probably to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>be explained like Anaximander’s. Simplicius, indeed,
takes another view;<a id='r167' /><a href='#f167' class='c014'><sup>[167]</sup></a> but he may have been misled
by a Stoic authority.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Influence of Anaximenes.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec31'></a>31. It is not quite easy for us to realise that,
in the eyes of his contemporaries, and for long after,
Anaximenes was a much more important figure than
Anaximander. And yet the fact is certain. We shall
see that Pythagoras, though he followed Anaximander
in his account of the heavenly bodies, was far more
indebted to Anaximenes for his general theory of
reality (<a href='#sec53'>§ 53</a>). We shall see further that when, at a
later date, science revived once more in Ionia, it
was “the philosophy of Anaximenes” to which it
attached itself (<a href='#sec122'>§ 122</a>). Anaxagoras adopted many of
his most characteristic views (<a href='#sec135'>§ 135</a>), and some of them
even found their way into the cosmology of the
Atomists.<a id='r168' /><a href='#f168' class='c014'><sup>[168]</sup></a> Diogenes of Apollonia went back to the
central doctrine of Anaximenes, and once more made
Air the primary substance, though he also tried to
combine it with the theories of Anaxagoras (<a href='#sec188'>§ 188</a>).
We shall come to all this later on; but it seemed
desirable to point out at once that Anaximenes marks
the culminating point of the line of thought which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>started with Thales, and to show how the “philosophy
of Anaximenes” came to mean the Milesian doctrine
as a whole. This it can only have done because it was
really the work of a school, of which Anaximenes was
the last distinguished representative, and because his
contribution to it was one that completed the system
he had inherited from his predecessors. That the
theory of rarefaction and condensation was really
such a completion of the Milesian system, we have
seen already (<a href='#sec26'>§ 26</a>), and it need only be added that a
clear realisation of this fact will be the best clue at
once to the understanding of the Milesian cosmology
itself and to that of the systems which followed it. In
the main, it is from Anaximenes that they all start.</p>

been said upon the subject. Jacoby (pp. 170 sqq.) argues strongly for 582/1,
the date now generally accepted. Others favour the Pythian year 586/5
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, which is the very year of the eclipse, and this would help to explain
how those historians who used Apollodoros came to date it a year too
late; for Damasias was archon for two years and two months. It is
even possible that they misunderstood the words Δαμασίου τοῦ δευτέρου,
which are intended to distinguish him from an earlier archon of the same
name, as meaning “in the second year of Damasias.” Apollodoros gave
only Athenian archons, and the reduction to Olympiads is the work of
later writers. Kirchner, adopting the year 582/1 for Damasias, brings the
archonship of Solon down to 591/0 (<cite>Rh. Mus.</cite> liii. pp. 242 sqq.). But the
date of Solon’s archonship can never have been doubtful. On Kirchner’s

the shadows of all objects will probably be equal to the objects at the same

τὴν βακτηρίαν στήσας ἐπὶ τῷ πέρατι τῆς σκιᾶς ἣν ἡ πυραμὶς ἐποίει, γενομένων

earlier sources (Orph. frag. 2, Diels, <cite>Vors.</cite> 1st ed. p. 491). In quoting this
suggestion, Aristotle refers it to “some”—a word which often means Plato—and
he calls the originators of the theory παμπαλαίους, as Plato had
done (<cite>Met.</cite> 983 b 28; cf. <cite>Tht.</cite> 181 b 3). This is a characteristic

15 (R. P. 16), stood by themselves, no one would ever have supposed them
to mean that Anaximander called the Boundless ἀρχή. They would
naturally be rendered: “having been the first to introduce this name (<i>i.e.</i>
τὸ ἄπειρον) for the ἀρχή”; but the words of Hippolytos (<cite>Ref.</cite> i. 6, 2),
πρῶτος τοὔνομα καλέσας τῆς ἀρχῆς, have led nearly all writers to take the
passage in the less obvious sense. We now know, however, that
Hippolytos is no independent authority, but rests altogether on Theophrastos;
so the natural view to take is that either his immediate source,
or he himself, or a copyist, has dropped out τοῦτο before τοὔνομα, and
corrupted κομίσας into καλέσας. It is not credible that Theophrastos made
both statements. The other passage from Simplicius compared by Usener
(p. 150, 23), πρῶτος αὐτὸς ἀρχὴν ὀνομάσας τὸ ὑποκείμενον, does not seem
to me to have anything to do with the question. It means simply that
Anaximander was the first to name the substratum as the “material cause,”
which is a different point altogether. This is how Neuhäuser takes the
passage (<cite>Anaximander</cite>, pp. 7 sqq.); but I cannot agree with him in holding
that the <em>word</em> ὑποκείμενον is ascribed to the Milesian.</p>

name, τῷ οὕτως ἂν μόνον μὴ ὑπολείπειν γένεσιν καὶ φθοράν, εἰ ἄπειρον εἴη

<p class='c002'><a href='#r114'>114</a>. I have assumed that the word ἄπειρον means <em>spatially infinite</em> (though
not in any precise mathematical sense), not <em>qualitatively indeterminate</em>, as
maintained by Teichmüller and Tannery. The decisive reasons for holding
that the sense of the word is “boundless in extent” are as follows: (1)
Theophrastos said that the primary substance of Anaximander was ἄπειρον
and contained all the worlds, and the word περιέχειν everywhere means
“to encompass,” not, as has been suggested, “to contain potentially.” (2)
Aristotle says (<cite>Phys.</cite> Γ, 4. 203 b 23) διὰ γὰρ τὸ ἐν τῇ νοήσει μὴ ὑπολείπειν
καὶ ὁ ἀριθμὸς δοκεῖ ἄπειρος εἶναι καὶ τὰ μαθηματικὰ μεγέθη καὶ τὰ ἔξω τοῦ
οὐρανοῦ· ἀπείρου δ’ ὄντος τοῦ ἔξω, καὶ σῶμα ἄπειρον εἶναι δοκεῖ καὶ κόσμοι.

and he identified it with Air, which is not qualitatively indeterminate.</p>

place and settle there.” For the relation of Pythagoreanism to

motion with the diurnal revolution is insisted on by Teichmüller and
Tannery, and is the real source of the very unnatural interpretation which
they give to the word ἄπειρον. It was obviously difficult to credit
Anaximander with a belief in an infinite body which revolves in a circle.
The whole theory rests upon a confusion between the finite spherical
κόσμος within the οὐρανός and the infinite περιέχον outside it.</p>

that all the γαλεοί except the ἀκανθίας “send out their young and take

the thing happen with their own eyes.</p>

</div>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Migrations to the West.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec32'></a>32. So far we have not met with any trace of direct
antagonism between science and popular beliefs, though
the views of the Milesian cosmologists were really as
inconsistent with the religions of the people as with
the mythology of the anthropomorphic poets.<a id='r169' /><a href='#f169' class='c014'><sup>[169]</sup></a> Two
things hastened the conflict—the shifting of the scene
to the West, and the religious revival which swept over
Hellas in the sixth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c002'>The chief figures in the philosophical history of the
period were Pythagoras of Samos and Xenophanes of
Kolophon. Both were Ionians by birth, and yet both
spent the greater part of their lives in the West. We
see from Herodotos how the Persian advance in Asia
Minor occasioned a series of migrations to Sicily and
Southern Italy;<a id='r170' /><a href='#f170' class='c014'><sup>[170]</sup></a> and this, of course, made a great
difference to philosophy as well as to religion. The
new views had probably grown up so naturally and
gradually in Ionia that the shock of conflict and
reaction was avoided; but that could no longer be so,
when they were transplanted to a region where men
were wholly unprepared to receive them.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Another, though a somewhat later, effect of these
migrations was to bring Science into contact with
Rhetoric, one of the most characteristic products of
Western Hellas. Already in Parmenides we may note
the presence of that dialectical and controversial spirit
which was destined to have so great an influence on
Greek thought, and it was just this fusion of the art of
arguing for victory with the search for truth that
before long gave birth to Logic.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The religious revival.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec33'></a>33. Most important of all in its influence on
philosophy was the religious revival which culminated
about this time. The religion of continental Hellas
had developed in a very different way from that of
Ionia. In particular, the worship of Dionysos, which
came from Thrace, and is barely mentioned in Homer,
contained in germ a wholly new way of looking at
man’s relation to the world. It would certainly be
wrong to credit the Thracians themselves with any
very exalted views; but there can be no doubt that, to
the Greeks, the phenomenon of ecstasy suggested that
the soul was something more than a feeble double of
the self, and that it was only when “out of the body”
it could show its true nature.<a id='r171' /><a href='#f171' class='c014'><sup>[171]</sup></a> To a less extent, such
ideas were also suggested by the worship of Demeter,
whose mysteries were celebrated at Eleusis; though, in
later days, these came to take the leading place in
men’s minds. That was because they were incorporated
in the public religion of Athens.</p>

<p class='c002'>Before the time with which we are dealing, tradition
shows us dimly an age of inspired prophets—Bakides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>and Sibyls—followed by one of strange medicine-men
like Abaris and Aristeas of Prokonnesos. With
Epimenides of Crete, we touch the fringe of history,
while Pherekydes of Syros is the contemporary of the
early cosmologists, and we still have some fragments
of his discourse. It looked as if Greek religion were
about to enter upon the same stage as that already
reached by the religions of the East; and, but for the
rise of science, it is hard to see what could have checked
this tendency. It is usual to say that the Greeks were
saved from a religion of the Oriental type by their
having no priesthood; but this is to mistake the effect
for the cause. Priesthoods do not make dogmas,
though they preserve them once they are made; and
in the earlier stages of their development, the Oriental
peoples had no priesthoods either in the sense intended.<a id='r172' /><a href='#f172' class='c014'><sup>[172]</sup></a>
It was not so much the absence of a priesthood as the
existence of the scientific schools that saved Greece.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Orphic religion.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec34'></a>34. The new religion—for in one sense it was new,
though in another as old as mankind—reached its
highest point of development with the foundation of
the Orphic communities. So far as we can see, the
original home of these was Attika; but they spread
with extraordinary rapidity, especially in Southern
Italy and Sicily.<a id='r173' /><a href='#f173' class='c014'><sup>[173]</sup></a> They were first of all associations
for the worship of Dionysos; but they were distinguished
by two features which were new among the
Hellenes. They looked to a revelation as the source
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>of religious authority, and they were organised as
artificial communities. The poems which contained
their theology were ascribed to the Thracian Orpheus,
who had himself descended into Hades, and was
therefore a safe guide through the perils which beset
the disembodied soul in the next world. We have
considerable remains of this literature, but they are
mostly of late date, and cannot safely be used as
evidence for the beliefs of the sixth century. We do
know, however, that the leading ideas of Orphicism
were quite early. A number of thin gold plates with
Orphic verses inscribed on them have been discovered
in Southern Italy;<a id='r174' /><a href='#f174' class='c014'><sup>[174]</sup></a> and though these are somewhat
later in date than the period with which we are
dealing, they belong to the time when Orphicism was
a living creed and not a fantastic revival. What can
be made out from them as to the doctrine has a
startling resemblance to the beliefs which were
prevalent in India about the same time, though it
seems impossible that there should have been any
actual contact between India and Greece at this date.
The main purpose of the <cite>Orgia</cite><a id='r175' /><a href='#f175' class='c014'><sup>[175]</sup></a> was to “purify” the
believer’s soul, and so enable it to escape from the
“wheel of birth,” and it was for the better attainment of
this end that the Orphics were organised in communities.
Religious associations must have been known to the
Greeks from a fairly early date;<a id='r176' /><a href='#f176' class='c014'><sup>[176]</sup></a> but the oldest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>these were based, at least in theory, on the tie of
kindred blood. What was new was the institution of
communities to which any one might be admitted by
initiation.<a id='r177' /><a href='#f177' class='c014'><sup>[177]</sup></a> This was, in fact, the establishment of
churches, though there is no evidence that these were
connected with each other in such a way that we
could rightly speak of them as a single church. The
Pythagoreans came nearer to realising that.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Philosophy as a Way of Life.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec35'></a>35. We have to take account of the religious
revival here, chiefly because it suggested the view that
philosophy was above all a “way of life.” Science too
was a “purification,” a means of escape from the
“wheel.” This is the view expressed so strongly in
Plato’s <cite>Phaedo</cite>, which was written under the influence
of Pythagorean ideas.<a id='r178' /><a href='#f178' class='c014'><sup>[178]</sup></a> Sokrates became to his
followers the ideal “wise man,” and it was to this side
of his personality the Cynics mainly attached themselves.
From them proceeded the Stoic sage and the Christian
saint, and also the whole brood of impostors whom
Lucian has pilloried for our edification.<a id='r179' /><a href='#f179' class='c014'><sup>[179]</sup></a> Saints and
sages are apt to appear in questionable shapes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Apollonios of Tyana showed in the end where this
view may lead. It was not wholly absent from any
Greek philosophy after the days of Pythagoras.
Aristotle is as much possessed by it as any one, as we
may see from the Tenth Book of the <cite>Ethics</cite>, and as we
should see still more distinctly if we possessed such
works as the <cite>Protreptikos</cite> in their entirety.<a id='r180' /><a href='#f180' class='c014'><sup>[180]</sup></a> Plato,
indeed, tried to make the ideal wise man of service to
the state and mankind by his doctrine of the philosopher
king. It was he alone, so far as we know, that
insisted on philosophers descending by turns into the
cave from which they had been released and coming
to the help of their former fellow-prisoners.<a id='r181' /><a href='#f181' class='c014'><sup>[181]</sup></a> That was
not, however, the view that prevailed, and the “wise
man” became more and more detached from the
world. Apollonios of Tyana was quite entitled to
regard himself as the spiritual heir of Pythagoras; for
the theurgy and thaumaturgy of the late Greek schools
was but the fruit of the seed sown in the generation
before the Persian Wars.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>No doctrine in the “Mysteries.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec36'></a>36. On the other hand, it would be wrong to
suppose that Orphicism or the Mysteries suggested any
definite doctrines to philosophers, at least during the
period which we are about to consider. We have
admitted that they really implied a new view of the
soul, and we might therefore have expected to find
that they profoundly modified men’s theory of the
world and their relation to it. The striking thing is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>that this did not happen. Even those philosophers
who were most closely in touch with the religious
movement, like Empedokles and the Pythagoreans,
held views about the soul which really contradicted
the theory implied by their religious practices.<a id='r182' /><a href='#f182' class='c014'><sup>[182]</sup></a> There
is no room for an immortal soul in any philosophy of
this period. Up to Plato’s time immortality was
never treated in a scientific way, but merely assumed
in the Orphic rites, to which Plato half seriously turns
for confirmation of his own teaching.<a id='r183' /><a href='#f183' class='c014'><sup>[183]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>All this is easily accounted for. With us a
religious revival generally means the vivid realisation
of a new or forgotten doctrine, while ancient religion
has properly no doctrine at all. “The initiated,”
Aristotle said, “were not expected to learn anything,
but merely to be affected in a certain way and put
into a certain frame of mind.”<a id='r184' /><a href='#f184' class='c014'><sup>[184]</sup></a> Nothing was required
but that the ritual should be correctly performed, and
the worshipper was free to give any explanation of
it he pleased. It might be as exalted as that of
Pindar and Sophokles, or as material as that of the
itinerant mystery-mongers described by Plato in the

<div class='sidenote'>Character of the tradition.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec37'></a>37. It is no easy task to give an account of Pythagoras
that can claim to be regarded as history. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>principal sources of information<a id='r185' /><a href='#f185' class='c014'><sup>[185]</sup></a> are the Lives composed
by Iamblichos, Porphyry, and Laertios Diogenes.
That of Iamblichos is a wretched compilation, based
chiefly on the work of the arithmetician Nikomachos
of Gerasa in Judaea, and the romance of Apollonios
of Tyana, who regarded himself as a second Pythagoras,
and accordingly took great liberties with his materials.<a id='r186' /><a href='#f186' class='c014'><sup>[186]</sup></a>
Porphyry stands, as a writer, on a far higher level than
Iamblichos; but his authorities do not inspire us with
more confidence. He, too, made use of Nikomachos,
and of a certain novelist called Antonius Diogenes,
author of a work entitled <cite>Marvels from beyond Thule</cite>.<a id='r187' /><a href='#f187' class='c014'><sup>[187]</sup></a>
Diogenes quotes, as usual, a considerable number of
authorities, and the statements he makes must be
estimated according to the nature of the sources from
which they were drawn.<a id='r188' /><a href='#f188' class='c014'><sup>[188]</sup></a> So far, it must be confessed,
our material does not seem promising. Further
examination shows, however, that a good many
fragments of two much older authorities, Aristoxenos
and Dikaiarchos, are embedded in the mass. These
writers were both disciples of Aristotle; they were
natives of Southern Italy, and contemporary with the
last generation of the Pythagorean school. Both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>wrote accounts of Pythagoras; and Aristoxenos, who
was personally intimate with the last representatives
of scientific Pythagoreanism, also made a collection
of the sayings of his friends. Now the Neopythagorean
story, as we have it in Iamblichos, is a tissue of
incredible and fantastic myths; but, if we sift out
the statements which go back to Aristoxenos and
Dikaiarchos, we can easily construct a rational narrative,
in which Pythagoras appears not as a miracle-monger
and religious innovator, but simply as a moralist and
statesman. We might then be tempted to suppose
that this is the genuine tradition; but that would be
altogether a mistake. There is, in fact, a third and
still earlier stratum in the Lives, and this agrees with
the latest accounts in representing Pythagoras as a
wonder-worker and a religious reformer.</p>

<p class='c002'>Some of the most striking miracles of Pythagoras
are related on the authority of Andron’s <cite>Tripod</cite>, and
of Aristotle’s work on the Pythagoreans.<a id='r189' /><a href='#f189' class='c014'><sup>[189]</sup></a> Both these
treatises belong to the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and
are therefore untouched by Neopythagorean fancies.
Further, it is only by assuming the still earlier
existence of this view that we can explain the allusions
of Herodotos. The Hellespontine Greeks told him
that Salmoxis or Zamolxis had been a slave of
Pythagoras,<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c014'><sup>[190]</sup></a> and Salmoxis is a figure of the same
class as Abaris and Aristeas.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>It seems, then, that both the oldest and the latest
accounts agree in representing Pythagoras as a man
of the class to which Epimenides and Onomakritos
belonged—in fact, as a sort of “medicine-man”; but,
for some reason, there was an attempt to save his
memory from this imputation, and that attempt
belonged to the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> The significance
of this will appear in the sequel.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Life of Pythagoras.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec38'></a>38. We may be said to know for certain that
Pythagoras passed his early manhood at Samos, and
was the son of Mnesarchos;<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c014'><sup>[191]</sup></a> and he “flourished,” we
are told, in the reign of Polykrates.<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c014'><sup>[192]</sup></a> This date
cannot be far wrong; for Herakleitos already speaks
of him in the past tense.<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c014'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The extensive travels attributed to Pythagoras by
late writers are, of course, apocryphal. Even the
statement that he visited Egypt, though far from
improbable if we consider the close relations between
Polykrates of Samos and Amasis, rests on no sufficient
authority.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c014'><sup>[194]</sup></a> Herodotos, it is true, observes that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Egyptians agreed in certain practices with the rules
called Orphic and Bacchic, which are really Egyptian,
and with the Pythagoreans;<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c014'><sup>[195]</sup></a> but this does not imply
that the Pythagoreans derived these directly from
Egypt. He says also in another place that the belief
in transmigration came from Egypt, though certain
Greeks, both at an earlier and a later date, had passed
it off as their own. He refuses, however, to give their
names, so he can hardly be referring to Pythagoras.<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c014'><sup>[196]</sup></a>
Nor does it matter; for the Egyptians did not believe
in transmigration at all, and Herodotos was simply
deceived by the priests or the symbolism of the
monuments.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aristoxenos said that Pythagoras left Samos in
order to escape from the tyranny of Polykrates.<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c014'><sup>[197]</sup></a> It
was at Kroton, a city already famous for its medical
school,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c014'><sup>[198]</sup></a> that he founded his society. How long he
remained there we do not know; he died at Metapontion,
whither he had retired on the first signal of
revolt against his influence.<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c014'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Order.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span><a id='sec39'></a>39. There is no reason to believe that the detailed
statements which have been handed down with regard
to the organisation of the Pythagorean Order rest upon
any historical basis, and in the case of many of them
we can still see how they came to be made. The
distinction of grades within the Order, variously called
<em>Mathematicians</em> and <em>Akousmatics</em>, <em>Esoterics</em> and <em>Exoterics</em>,
<em>Pythagoreans</em> and <em>Pythagorists</em>,<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c014'><sup>[200]</sup></a> is an invention designed
to explain how there came to be two widely different
sets of people, each calling themselves disciples of
Pythagoras, in the fourth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> So, too, the
statement that the Pythagoreans were bound to
inviolable secrecy, which goes back to Aristoxenos,<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c014'><sup>[201]</sup></a>
is intended to explain why there is no trace of the
Pythagorean philosophy proper before Philolaos.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Pythagorean Order was simply, in its origin, a
religious fraternity of the type described above, and not,
as has sometimes been maintained, a political league.<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c014'><sup>[202]</sup></a>
Nor had it anything to do with the “Dorian aristocratic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>ideal.” Pythagoras was an Ionian, and the Order was
originally confined to Achaian states.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c014'><sup>[203]</sup></a> Nor is there the
slightest evidence that the Pythagoreans favoured the
aristocratic rather than the democratic party.<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c014'><sup>[204]</sup></a> The
main purpose of the Order was to secure for its own
members a more adequate satisfaction of the religious
instinct than that supplied by the State religion. It
was, in fact, an institution for the cultivation of holiness.
In this respect it resembled an Orphic society,
though it seems that Apollo, rather than Dionysos,
was the chief Pythagorean god. That is doubtless
why the Krotoniates identified Pythagoras with Apollo
Hyperboreios.<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c014'><sup>[205]</sup></a> From the nature of the case, however,
an independent society within a Greek state was apt
to be brought into conflict with the larger body. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>only way in which it could then assert its right to
exist was by identifying the State with itself, that is,
by securing the control of the sovereign power. The
history of the Pythagorean Order, so far as it can be
traced, is, accordingly, the history of an attempt to
supersede the State; and its political action is to be
explained as a mere incident of that attempt.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Downfall of the Order.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec40'></a>40. For a time the new Order seems actually to
have succeeded in securing the supreme power, but
reaction came at last. Under the leadership of Kylon,
a wealthy noble, Kroton was able to assert itself
victoriously against the Pythagorean domination. This,
we may well believe, had been galling enough. The
“rule of the saints” would be nothing to it; and we
can still imagine and sympathise with the irritation felt
by the plain man of those days at having his legislation
done for him by a set of incomprehensible pedants, who
made a point of abstaining from beans, and would not
let him beat his own dog because they recognised in
its howls the voice of a departed friend (Xenophanes,
fr. 7). This feeling would be aggravated by the private
religious worship of the Society. Greek states could
never pardon the introduction of new gods. Their
objection to this was not, however, that the gods in
question were false gods. If they had been, it would
not have mattered so much. What they could not
tolerate was that any one should establish a private
means of communication between himself and the
unseen powers. That introduced an unknown and
incalculable element into the arrangements of the
State, which might very likely be hostile to those citizens
who had no means of propitiating the intruding divinity.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aristoxenos’s version of the events which led to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>downfall of the Pythagorean Order is given at length
by Iamblichos. According to this, Pythagoras had
refused to receive Kylon into his Society, and he therefore
became a bitter foe of the Order. From this
cause Pythagoras removed from Kroton to Metapontion,
where he died. The Pythagoreans, however, still
retained possession of the government of Kroton, till
at last the partisans of Kylon set fire to Milo’s house,
where they were assembled. Of those in the house
only two, Archippos and Lysis, escaped. Archippos
retired to Taras; Lysis, first to Achaia and then to
Thebes, where he became later on the teacher of
Epameinondas. The Pythagoreans who remained
concentrated themselves at Rhegion; but, as things went
from bad to worse, they all left Italy except Archippos.<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c014'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>This account has all the air of being historical.
The mention of Lysis proves, however, that those
events were spread over more than one generation.
The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>coup d’état</i></span> of Kroton can hardly have occurred
before 450 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, if the teacher of Epameinondas
escaped from it, and it may well have been even later.
But it must have been before 410 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> that the
Pythagoreans left Rhegion for Hellas; Philolaos was
certainly at Thebes about that time.<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c014'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The political power of the Pythagoreans as an
Order was now gone for ever, though we shall see that
some of them returned to Italy at a later date. In
exile they seem to have dropped the merely magical
and superstitious parts of their system, and this enabled
them to take their place as one of the scientific schools
of Hellas.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Want of evidence as to the teaching of Pythagoras.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec41'></a>41. Of the opinions of Pythagoras we know even
less than of his life. Aristotle clearly knew nothing
for certain of ethical or physical doctrines going back
to the founder of the Society himself.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c014'><sup>[208]</sup></a> Aristoxenos
only gave a string of moral precepts.<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c014'><sup>[209]</sup></a> Dikaiarchos is
quoted by Porphyry as asserting that hardly anything
of what Pythagoras taught his disciples was known
except the doctrine of transmigration, the periodic
cycle, and the kinship of all living creatures.<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c014'><sup>[210]</sup></a> The
fact is, that, like all teachers who introduce a new way
of living rather than a new view of the world, Pythagoras
preferred oral instruction to the dissemination of his
opinions by writing, and it was not till Alexandrian
times that any one ventured to forge books in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>name. The writings ascribed to the earliest Pythagoreans
were also forgeries of the same period.<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c014'><sup>[211]</sup></a> The
early history of Pythagoreanism is, therefore, wholly
conjectural; but we may still make an attempt to
understand, in a very general way, what the position
of Pythagoras in the history of Greek thought must
have been.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Transmigration.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec42'></a>42. In the first place, then, there can be no doubt
that he really taught the doctrine of transmigration.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c014'><sup>[212]</sup></a>
The story told by the Greeks of the Hellespont and
Pontos as to his relations with Salmoxis could never
have gained currency by the time of Herodotos if he
had not been known as a man who taught strange
views of the life after death.<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c014'><sup>[213]</sup></a> Now the doctrine of
transmigration is most easily to be explained as a
development of the savage belief in the kinship of men
and beasts, as all alike children of the Earth,<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c014'><sup>[214]</sup></a> a view
which Dikaiarchos said Pythagoras certainly held.
Further, among savages, this belief is commonly
associated with a system of taboos on certain kinds of
food, and the Pythagorean rule is best known for its
prescription of similar forms of abstinence. This in
itself goes far to show that it originated in the same
ideas, and we have seen that the revival of these would
be quite natural in connexion with the foundation of
a new religious society. There is a further consideration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>which tells strongly in the same direction. In
India we have a precisely similar doctrine, and yet it
is not possible to assume any actual borrowing of
Indian ideas at this date. The only explanation
which will account for the facts is that the two systems
were independently evolved from the same primitive
ideas. These are found in many parts of the world;
but it seems to have been only in India and in Greece
that they were developed into an elaborate doctrine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Abstinence.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec43'></a>43. It has indeed been doubted whether we have
a right to accept what we are told by such late writers
as Porphyry on the subject of Pythagorean abstinence.
Aristoxenos, whom we have admitted to be one of our
earliest witnesses, may be cited to prove that the
original Pythagoreans knew nothing of these restrictions
on the use of animal flesh and beans. He
undoubtedly said that Pythagoras did not abstain from
animal flesh in general, but only from that of the
ploughing ox and the ram.<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c014'><sup>[215]</sup></a> He also said that Pythagoras
preferred beans to every other vegetable, as being
the most laxative, and that he was partial to sucking-pigs
and tender kids.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c014'><sup>[216]</sup></a> Aristoxenos, however, is a witness
who very often breaks down under cross-examination,
and the palpable exaggeration of these statements
shows that he is endeavouring to combat a belief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>which existed in his own day. We are therefore able
to show, out of his own mouth, that the tradition which
made the Pythagoreans abstain from animal flesh and
beans goes back to a time long before there were any
Neopythagoreans interested in upholding it. Still, it
may be asked what motive Aristoxenos could have had
for denying the common belief? The answer is simple
and instructive. He had been the friend of the last
of the Pythagoreans; and, in their time, the merely
superstitious part of Pythagoreanism had been dropped,
except by some zealots whom the heads of the Society
refused to acknowledge. That is why he represents
Pythagoras himself in so different a light from both
the older and the later traditions; it is because he
gives us the view of the more enlightened sect of the
Order. Those who clung faithfully to the old practices
were now regarded as heretics, and all manner of
theories were set on foot to account for their existence.
It was related, for instance, that they descended from
one of the “Akousmatics,” who had never been initiated
into the deeper mysteries of the “Mathematicians.”<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c014'><sup>[217]</sup></a>
All this, however, is pure invention. The satire of the
poets of the Middle Comedy proves clearly enough
that, even though the friends of Aristoxenos did not
practise abstinence, there were plenty of people in the
fourth century, calling themselves followers of Pythagoras,
who did.<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c014'><sup>[218]</sup></a> History has not been kind to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Akousmatics, but they never wholly died out. The
names of Diodoros of Aspendos and Nigidius Figulus
help to bridge the gulf between them and Apollonios
of Tyana.</p>

<p class='c002'>We know, then, that Pythagoras taught the kinship
of beasts and men, and we infer that his rule of
abstinence from flesh was based, not upon humanitarian
or ascetic grounds, but on taboo. This is strikingly
confirmed by a fact which we are told in Porphyry’s
<cite>Defence of Abstinence</cite>. The statement in question does
not indeed go back to Theophrastos, as so much of
Porphyry’s tract certainly does;<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c014'><sup>[219]</sup></a> but it is, in all
probability, due to Herakleides of Pontos, and is to the
effect that, though the Pythagoreans did as a rule
abstain from flesh, they nevertheless ate it when they
sacrificed to the gods.<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c014'><sup>[220]</sup></a> Now, among savage peoples,
we often find that the sacred animal is slain and eaten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>sacramentally by its kinsmen on certain solemn
occasions, though in ordinary circumstances this would
be the greatest of all impieties. Here, again, we have
to do with a very primitive belief; and we need not
therefore attach any weight to the denials of
Aristoxenos.<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c014'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'><em>Akousmata.</em></div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec44'></a>44. We shall now know what to think of the various
Pythagorean rules and precepts which have come down
to us. These are of two kinds, and have very different
sources. Some of them, derived from the collection of
Aristoxenos, and for the most part preserved by
Iamblichos, are mere precepts of morality. They do
not pretend to go back to Pythagoras himself; they
are only the sayings which the last generation of
“Mathematicians” heard from their predecessors.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c014'><sup>[222]</sup></a> The
second class is of a very different nature, and the sayings
which belong to it are called <em>Akousmata</em>,<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c014'><sup>[223]</sup></a> which points
to their being the property of that sect of Pythagoreans
which had faithfully preserved the old customs. Later
writers interpret them as “symbols” of moral truth;
but their interpretations are extremely far-fetched, and
it does not require a very practised eye to see that
they are genuine taboos of a thoroughly primitive type.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>I give a few examples in order that the reader may
judge what the famous Pythagorean rule of life was
really like.</p>

  <ul  class='ul_2'>
    <li>1. To abstain from beans.

    </li>
    <li>2. Not to pick up what has fallen.

    </li>
    <li>3. Not to touch a white cock.

    </li>
    <li>4. Not to break bread.

    </li>
    <li>5. Not to step over a crossbar.

    </li>
    <li>6. Not to stir the fire with iron.

    </li>
    <li>7. Not to eat from a whole loaf.

    </li>
    <li>8. Not to pluck a garland.

    </li>
    <li>9. Not to sit on a quart measure.

    </li>
    <li>10. Not to eat the heart.

    </li>
    <li>11. Not to walk on highways.

    </li>
    <li>12. Not to let swallows share one’s roof.

    </li>
    <li>13. When the pot is taken off the fire, not to leave the mark of it in the ashes, but 
    to stir them together.

    </li>
    <li>14. Do not look in a mirror beside a light.

    </li>
    <li>15. When you rise from the bedclothes, roll them together and smooth out the impress 
    of the body.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c002'>It would be easy to multiply proofs of the close
connexion between Pythagoreanism and primitive
modes of thought, but what has been said is really
sufficient for our purpose. The kinship of men and
beasts, the abstinence from flesh, and the doctrine of
transmigration all hang together and form a perfectly
intelligible whole from the point of view which has been
indicated.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Pythagoras as a man of science.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec45'></a>45. Were this all, we should be tempted to delete
the name of Pythagoras from the history of philosophy
altogether, and relegate him to the class of “medicine-men”
(γόητες) along with Epimenides and Onomakritos.
This, however, would be quite wrong. As we shall see,
the Pythagorean Society became one of the chief scientific
schools of Hellas, and it is certain that Pythagorean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>science as well as Pythagorean religion originated with
the master himself. Herakleitos, who is not partial to
him, says that Pythagoras had pursued scientific
investigation further than other men, though he also
says that he turned his much learning into an art of
mischief.<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a> Herodotos called Pythagoras “by no
means the weakest sophist of the Hellenes,” a title
which at this date does not imply the slightest
disparagement.<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c014'><sup>[225]</sup></a> Aristotle even said that Pythagoras
first busied himself with mathematics and numbers, and
that it was later on he attached himself to the miracle-mongering
of Pherekydes.<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c014'><sup>[226]</sup></a> Is it possible for us to
trace any connexion between these two sides of his
activity?</p>

<p class='c002'>We have seen that the aim of the Orphic and other
<cite>Orgia</cite> was to obtain release from the “wheel of birth”
by means of “purifications,” which were generally of
a very primitive type. The new thing in the Society
founded by Pythagoras seems to have been that, while
it admitted all these half-savage customs, it at the
same time suggested a more exalted idea of what
“purification” really was. Aristoxenos tells us that
the Pythagoreans employed music to purge the soul
as they used medicine to purge the body, and it is
abundantly clear that Aristotle’s famous theory of
κάθαρσις is derived from Pythagorean sources.<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c014'><sup>[227]</sup></a> Such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>methods of purifying the soul were familiar in the <cite>Orgia</cite>
of the Korybantes, and will serve to explain the
Pythagorean interest in Harmonics. But there is more
than this. If we can trust Herakleides so far, it was
Pythagoras who first distinguished the “three lives,”
the Theoretic, the Practical, and the Apolaustic, which
Aristotle made use of in the <cite>Ethics</cite>. The general
theory of these lives is clear, and it is impossible to
doubt that in substance it belongs to the very beginning
of the school. It is to this effect. We are strangers in
this world, and the body is the tomb of the soul, and yet
we must not seek to escape by self-murder; for we are
the chattels of God who is our herdsman, and without
his command we have no right to make our escape.<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c014'><sup>[228]</sup></a>
In this life, there are three kinds of men, just as there
are three sorts of people who come to the Olympic
Games. The lowest class is made up of those who
come to buy and sell, and next above them are those
who come to compete. Best of all, however, are those
who come simply to look on (θεωρεῖν). The greatest
purification of all is, therefore, disinterested science, and
it is the man who devotes himself to that, the true
philosopher, who has most effectually released himself
from the “wheel of birth.” It would be rash to say
that Pythagoras expressed himself exactly in this
manner; but all these ideas are genuinely Pythagorean,
and it is only in some such way that we can bridge
the gulf which separates Pythagoras the man of science
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>from Pythagoras the religious teacher.<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c014'><sup>[229]</sup></a> We must now
endeavour to discover how much of the later Pythagorean
science may reasonably be ascribed to Pythagoras
himself.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Arithmetic.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec46'></a>46. In his treatise on Arithmetic, Aristoxenos said
that Pythagoras was the first to carry that study
beyond the needs of commerce,<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c014'><sup>[230]</sup></a> and his statement is
confirmed by everything we otherwise know. By the
end of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, we find that there is a
widespread interest in such subjects and that these are
studied for their own sake. Now this new interest
cannot have been wholly the work of a school; it must
have originated with some great man, and there is no
one but Pythagoras to whom we can refer it. As,
however, he wrote nothing, we have no sure means of
distinguishing his own teaching from that of his
followers in the next generation or two. All we can
safely say is that, the more primitive any Pythagorean
doctrine appears, the more likely it is to be that of
Pythagoras himself, and all the more so if it can be
shown to have points of contact with views which we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>know to have been held in his own time or shortly
before it. In particular, when we find the later
Pythagoreans teaching things that were already something
of an anachronism in their own day, we may be
reasonably sure that we are dealing with survivals
which only the authority of the master’s name could
have preserved. Some of these must be mentioned at
once, though the developed system belongs to a later
part of our story. It is only by separating its earliest
form from its later that the true place of Pythagoreanism
in Greek thought can be made clear, though we must
always remember that no one can now pretend to
draw the line between its successive stages with any
certainty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The figures.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec47'></a>47. Now one of the most remarkable statements
that we have about Pythagoreanism is what we are told
of Eurytos on the unimpeachable authority of Archytas.
Eurytos was the disciple of Philolaos, and Aristoxenos
expressly mentioned him along with Philolaos as
having taught the last of the Pythagoreans, the men
with whom he himself was personally acquainted. He
therefore belongs to the beginning of the fourth century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, by which time the Pythagorean system was fully
developed, and he was no eccentric enthusiast, but one
of the foremost men in the school.<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c014'><sup>[231]</sup></a> We are told
of him, then, that he used to give the number of
all sorts of things, such as horses and men, and
that he demonstrated these by arranging pebbles
in a certain way. It is to be noted further that
Aristotle compares his procedure to that of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>who bring numbers into figures like the triangle and
the square.<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c014'><sup>[232]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Now these statements, and especially the remark of
Aristotle last quoted, seem to imply the existence at
this date, and earlier, of a numerical symbolism quite
distinct from the alphabetical notation on the one hand
and from the Euclidean representation of numbers by
lines on the other. The former was inconvenient for
arithmetical purposes, just because the zero was one of
the few things the Greeks did not invent, and they
were therefore unable to develop a really serviceable
numerical symbolism based on position. The latter,
as will appear shortly, is intimately bound up with
that absorption of arithmetic by geometry, which is at
least as old as Plato, but cannot be primitive.<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c014'><sup>[233]</sup></a> It
seems rather that numbers were represented by dots
arranged in symmetrical and easily recognised patterns,
of which the marking of dice or dominoes gives us the
best idea. And these markings are, in fact, the best
proof that this is a genuinely primitive method of
indicating numbers; for they are of unknown antiquity,
and go back to the time when men could only count by
arranging numbers in such patterns, each of which became,
as it were, a fresh unit. This way of counting may well
be as old as reckoning with the fingers, or even older.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>It is, therefore, very significant that we do not find
any adequate account of what Aristotle can have meant
by “those who bring numbers into figures like the
triangle and the square” till we come to certain late
writers who called themselves Pythagoreans, and
revived the study of arithmetic as a science independent
of geometry. These men not only abandoned
the linear symbolism of Euclid, but also regarded the
alphabetical notation, which they did use, as something
conventional, and inadequate to represent the true
nature of number. Nikomachos of Gerasa says expressly
that the letters used to represent numbers are
only significant by human usage and convention. The
most natural way would be to represent linear or prime
numbers by a row of units, polygonal numbers by units
arranged so as to mark out the various plane figures,
and solid numbers by units disposed in pyramids and
so forth.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c014'><sup>[234]</sup></a> He therefore gives us figures like this:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>                               α              α α α</div>

    <div>                              α α             α α α</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>Now it ought to be obvious that this is no innovation,
but, like so many things in Neopythagoreanism, a
reversion to primitive usage. Of course the employment
of the letter <em>alpha</em> to represent the units is derived
from the conventional notation; but otherwise we are
clearly in presence of something which belongs to the
very earliest stage of the science—something, in fact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>which gives the only possible clue to the meaning of
Aristotle’s remark, and to what we are told of the
method of Eurytos.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Triangular, square, and oblong numbers.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec48'></a>48. This is still further confirmed by the tradition
which represents the great revelation made by Pythagoras
to mankind as having been precisely a figure of
this kind, namely the <em>tetraktys</em>, by which the Pythagoreans
used to swear,<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c014'><sup>[235]</sup></a> and we have no less an
authority than Speusippos for holding that the whole
theory which it implies was genuinely Pythagorean.<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c014'><sup>[236]</sup></a>
In later days there were many kinds of <em>tetraktys</em>,<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c014'><sup>[237]</sup></a> but
the original one, that by which the Pythagoreans
swore, was the “tetraktys of the dekad.” It was a
figure like this—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>•</div>
    <div>•   •</div>
    <div>•   •   •</div>
    <div>•   •   •   •</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>and represented the number ten as the triangle of four.
In other words, it showed at a glance that 1 + 2 + 3 +
4 = 10. Speusippos tells us of several properties
which the Pythagoreans discovered in the dekad. It
is, for instance, the first number that has in it an equal
number of prime and composite numbers. How much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>of this goes back to Pythagoras himself, we cannot
tell; but we are probably justified in referring to him
the conclusion that it is “according to nature” that all
Hellenes and barbarians count up to ten and then
begin over again.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is obvious that the <em>tetraktys</em> may be indefinitely
extended so as to exhibit the sums of the series of
successive numbers in a graphic form, and these sums
are accordingly called “triangular numbers.”</p>

<p class='c002'>For similar reasons, the sums of the series of
successive odd numbers are called “square numbers,”
and those of successive even numbers “oblong.” If
odd numbers are added to the unit in the form of
<em>gnomons</em>, the result is always a similar figure, namely a
square, while, if even numbers are added, we get a
series of rectangles,<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c014'><sup>[238]</sup></a> as shown by the figure:—</p>

<p class='c020'>It is clear, then, that we are entitled to refer the
study of sums of series to Pythagoras himself; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>whether he went beyond the oblong, and studied
pyramidal or cubic numbers, we cannot say.<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c014'><sup>[239]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Geometry and harmonics.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec49'></a>49. It is easy to see how this way of representing
numbers would suggest problems of a geometrical
nature. The dots which stand for the pebbles are
regularly called “boundary-stones” (ὅροι, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>termini</i></span>,
“terms”), and the area which they occupy, or rather
mark out, is the “field” (χώρα).<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c014'><sup>[240]</sup></a> This is evidently
a very early way of speaking, and may therefore be
referred to Pythagoras himself. Now it must have
struck him that “fields” could be compared as well as
numbers,<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c014'><sup>[241]</sup></a> and it is even likely that he knew the rough
methods of doing this which were traditional in Egypt,
though certainly these would fail to satisfy him.
Once more the tradition is singularly helpful in suggesting
the direction that his thoughts must have taken.
He knew, of course, the use of the triangle 3, 4, 5 in
constructing right angles. We have seen (p. 24) that
it was familiar in the East from a very early date, and
that Thales introduced it to the Hellenes, if they did
not know it already. In later writers it is actually
called the “Pythagorean triangle.” Now the Pythagorean
proposition <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>par excellence</i></span> is just that, in a right-angled
triangle, the square on the hypotenuse is equal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>to the squares on the other two sides, and the so-called
Pythagorean triangle is the application of its
converse to a particular case. The very name
“hypotenuse” affords strong confirmation of the intimate
connexion between the two things. It means
literally “the cord stretching over against,” and this is
surely just the rope of the “harpedonapt.”<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c014'><sup>[242]</sup></a> An early
tradition says that Pythagoras sacrificed an ox when
he discovered the proof of this proposition, and indeed
it was the real foundation of scientific mathematics.<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c014'><sup>[243]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Incommensurability.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec50'></a>50. One great disappointment, however, awaited
Pythagoras. It follows at once from the Pythagorean
proposition that the square on the diagonal of a square
is double the square on its side, and this ought surely
to be capable of numerical expression. As a matter
of fact, however, there is no square number which can
be divided into two equal square numbers, and so the
problem cannot be solved. In this sense, it is doubtless
true that Pythagoras discovered the incommensurability
of the diagonal and the side of a square, and the proof
mentioned by Aristotle, namely, that, if they were
commensurable, we should have to say that an even
number was equal to an odd number, is distinctly
Pythagorean in character.<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c014'><sup>[244]</sup></a> However that may be, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>is certain that Pythagoras did not care to pursue the
subject any further. He had, as it were, stumbled
on the fact that the square root of two is a surd, but
we know that it was left for Plato’s friends, Theodoros
of Kyrene and Theaitetos, to give a complete theory
of the matter.<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c014'><sup>[245]</sup></a> The fact is that the discovery of the
Pythagorean proposition, by giving birth to geometry,
had really superseded the old view of quantity as a
sum of units; but it was not till Plato’s time that the
full consequences of this were seen.<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c014'><sup>[246]</sup></a> For the present,
the incommensurability of the diagonal and the square
remained, as has been said, a “scandalous exception.”
Our tradition says that Hippasos of Metapontion was
drowned at sea for revealing this skeleton in the
cupboard.<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c014'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Proportion and harmony.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec51'></a>51. These last considerations show that, while it is
quite safe to attribute the substance of the First Book
of Euclid to Pythagoras, the arithmetic of Books VII.-IX.,
and the “geometrical algebra” of Book II. are
certainly not his. They operate with lines or with
areas instead of with units, and the relations which they
establish therefore hold good whether they are capable
of numerical expression or not. That is doubtless why
arithmetic is not treated in Euclid till after plane
geometry, a complete inversion of the original order.
For the same reason, the doctrine of proportion which
we find in Euclid cannot be Pythagorean, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>indeed the work of Eudoxos. Yet it is clear that the
early Pythagoreans, and probably Pythagoras himself,
studied proportion in their own way, and that the three
“medieties” in particular go back to the founder,
especially as the most complicated of them, the
“harmonic,” stands in close relation to his discovery of
the octave. If we take the harmonic proportion
12 : 8 : 6,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c014'><sup>[248]</sup></a> we find that 12 : 6 is the octave, 12 : 8 the
fifth, and 8 : 6 the fourth, and it can hardly be doubted
that it was Pythagoras himself who discovered these
intervals. The stories which have come down to us
about his observing the harmonic intervals in a smithy,
and then weighing the hammers that produced them,
or of his suspending weights corresponding to those of
the hammers to equal strings, are, indeed, impossible
and absurd; but it is sheer waste of time to rationalise
them.<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c014'><sup>[249]</sup></a> For our purpose their absurdity is their chief
merit. They are not stories which any Greek
mathematician or musician could possibly have invented,
but genuine popular tales bearing witness to
the existence of a real tradition that Pythagoras was
the author of this momentous discovery.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Things are numbers.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec52'></a>52. It was this too, no doubt, that led Pythagoras to
say all things were numbers. We shall see that, at a
later date, the Pythagoreans identified these numbers
with geometrical figures; but the mere fact that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>called them “numbers,” when taken in connexion with
what we are told about the method of Eurytos, is
sufficient to show this was not the original sense of
the doctrine. It is enough to suppose that Pythagoras
reasoned somewhat as follows. If musical sounds can
be reduced to numbers, why should not everything
else? There are many likenesses to number in things,
and it may well be that a lucky experiment, like that
by which the octave was discovered, will reveal their
true numerical nature. The Neopythagorean writers,
going back in this as in other matters to the earliest
tradition of the school, indulge their fancy in tracing
out analogies between things and numbers in endless
variety; but we are fortunately dispensed from
following them in these vagaries. Aristotle tells us
distinctly that the Pythagoreans explained only a
few things by means of numbers,<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c014'><sup>[250]</sup></a> which means that
Pythagoras himself left no developed doctrine on the subject,
while the Pythagoreans of the fifth century did not
care to add anything of the sort to the school tradition.
Aristotle does imply, however, that, according to them
the “right time” (καιρός) was seven, justice was four,
and marriage three. These identifications, with a few
others like them, we may safely refer to Pythagoras or
his immediate successors; but we must not attach
much importance to them. They are mere sports of
the analogical fancy. If we wish to understand the
cosmology of Pythagoras, we must start, not from
them, but from any statements we can find that
present points of contact with the teaching of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Milesian school. These, we may fairly infer, belong
to the system in its most primitive form.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cosmology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec53'></a>53. Now the most striking statement of this kind is
one of Aristotle’s. The Pythagoreans held, he tells us,
that there was “boundless breath” outside the heavens,
and that it was inhaled by the world.<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c014'><sup>[251]</sup></a> In substance,
this is the doctrine of Anaximenes, and it becomes
practically certain that it was that of Pythagoras,
when we find that Xenophanes denied it.<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c014'><sup>[252]</sup></a> We may
infer, then, that the further development of the idea is
also due to Pythagoras himself. We are told that, after
the first unit had been formed—however that may
have taken place—the nearest part of the Boundless
was first drawn in and limited;<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c014'><sup>[253]</sup></a> and further, that it is
just the Boundless thus inhaled that keeps the units
separate from each other.<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c014'><sup>[254]</sup></a> It represents the interval
between them. This is a very primitive way of
describing the nature of discrete quantity.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the passages of Aristotle just referred to, the
Boundless is also spoken of as the void or empty.
This identification of air and the void is a confusion
which we have already met with in Anaximenes, and
it need not surprise us to find it here too.<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c014'><sup>[255]</sup></a> We find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>also, as we might expect, distinct traces of the other
confusion, that of air and vapour. It seems certain,
in fact, that Pythagoras identified the Limit with fire,
and the Boundless with darkness. We are told by
Aristotle that Hippasos made Fire the first principle,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c014'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
and we shall see that Parmenides, in discussing the
opinions of his contemporaries, attributes to them the
view that there were two primary “forms,” Fire and
Night.<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c014'><sup>[257]</sup></a> We also find that Light and Darkness appear
in the Pythagorean table of opposites under the heads
of the Limit and the Unlimited respectively.<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c014'><sup>[258]</sup></a> The
identification of breath with darkness here implied is a
strong proof of the primitive character of the doctrine;
for in the sixth century darkness was supposed to be a
sort of vapour, while in the fifth, its true nature was
well known. Plato, with his usual historical tact,
makes the Pythagorean Timaios describe mist and
darkness as condensed air.<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c014'><sup>[259]</sup></a> We must think, then, of
a “field” of darkness or breath marked out by luminous
units, an imagination which the starry heavens would
naturally suggest. It is even probable that we should
ascribe to Pythagoras the Milesian view of a plurality
of worlds, though it would not have been natural for
him to speak of an infinite number. We know, at
least, that Petron, one of the early Pythagoreans, said
there were just a hundred and eighty-three worlds
arranged in a triangle;<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c014'><sup>[260]</sup></a> and Plato makes Timaios
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>admit, when laying down that there is only one world,
that something might be urged in favour of the view
that there are five, as there are five regular solids.<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c014'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The heavenly bodies.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec54'></a>54. Anaximander had regarded the heavenly bodies
as wheels of “air” filled with fire which escapes
through certain openings (<a href='#sec19'>§ 19</a>), and there is evidence
that Pythagoras adopted the same view.<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c014'><sup>[262]</sup></a> We have
seen that Anaximander only assumed the existence of
three such wheels, and held that the wheel of the sun
was the lowest. It is extremely probable that
Pythagoras identified the intervals between these rings
with the three musical intervals which he had
discovered, the fourth, the fifth, and the octave. That
would be the most natural beginning for the later
doctrine of the “harmony of the spheres,” though that
expression would be doubly misleading if applied to
any theory we can properly ascribe to Pythagoras
himself. The word ἁρμονία does not mean harmony,
and the “spheres” are an anachronism. We are still
at the stage when wheels or rings were considered
sufficient to account for the motions of the heavenly
bodies. It is also to be observed that sun, moon,
planets, and fixed stars must all be regarded as moving
in the same direction from east to west. Pythagoras
certainly did not ascribe to the planets an orbital motion
of their own from west to east. The old idea was rather
that they were left behind more or less every day. As
compared with the fixed stars, Saturn is left behind
least of all, and the Moon most; so, instead of saying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>that the Moon took a shorter time than Saturn to
complete its path through the signs of the Zodiac, men
said Saturn travelled quicker than the Moon, because
it more nearly succeeds in keeping up with the signs.
Instead of holding that Saturn takes thirty years to
complete its revolution, they said it took the fixed stars
thirty years to pass Saturn, and only twenty-nine days
and a half to pass the Moon. This is one of the
most important points to bear in mind regarding the
planetary systems of the Greeks, and we shall return
to it again.<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c014'><sup>[263]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The account just given of the views of Pythagoras
is, no doubt, conjectural and incomplete. We have
simply assigned to him those portions of the Pythagorean
system which appear to be the oldest, and it has not
even been possible at this stage to cite fully the
evidence on which our discussion is based. It will
only appear in its true light when we have examined
the second part of the poem of Parmenides and the
system of the later Pythagoreans.<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c014'><sup>[264]</sup></a> For reasons which
will then be apparent, I do not venture to ascribe to
Pythagoras himself the theory of the earth’s revolution
round the central fire. It seems safest to suppose
that he still adhered to the geocentric hypothesis of
Anaximander. In spite of this, however, it will be
clear that he opened a new period in the development
of Greek science, and it was certainly to his school that
its greatest discoveries were directly or indirectly due.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>When Plato deliberately attributes some of his own
most important discoveries to the Pythagoreans, he
was acknowledging in a characteristic way the debt he
owed them.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>II. <span class='sc'>Xenophanes of Kolophon</span></h3>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Life.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec55'></a>55. We have seen how Pythagoras identified himself
with the religious movement of his time; we have now
to consider a very different manifestation of the reaction
against that view of the gods which the poets had
made familiar to every one. Xenophanes denied the
anthropomorphic gods altogether, but was quite
unaffected by the revival of more primitive ideas that
was going on all round him. We still have a fragment
of an elegy in which he ridiculed Pythagoras and the
doctrine of transmigration. “Once, they say, he was
passing by when a dog was being ill-treated. ‘Stop!’
he said, ‘don’t hit it! It is the soul of a friend! I
knew it when I heard its voice.’”<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c014'><sup>[265]</sup></a> We are also told
that he opposed the views of Thales and Pythagoras,
and attacked Epimenides, which is likely enough,
though no fragments of the kind have come down to
us.<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c014'><sup>[266]</sup></a> His chief importance lies in the fact that he was
the author of the quarrel between philosophy and
poetry which culminated in Plato’s <cite>Republic</cite>.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is not easy to determine the date of Xenophanes.
Timaios said he was a contemporary of Hieron
and Epicharmos, and he certainly seems to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>played a part in the anecdotical romance of Hieron’s
court which amused the Greeks of the fourth century
much as that of Croesus and the Seven Wise Men
amused those of the fifth.<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c014'><sup>[267]</sup></a> As Hieron reigned
from 478 to 467 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, that would make it impossible
to date the birth of Xenophanes much earlier than 570
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, even if we suppose him to have lived till the
age of a hundred. On the other hand, both Sextus
and Clement say that Apollodoros gave Ol. XL. (620-616
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) as the date of his birth, and the former adds
that his days were prolonged till the time of Dareios
and Cyrus.<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c014'><sup>[268]</sup></a> Again, Diogenes, whose information
on such matters mostly comes from Apollodoros,
says that he flourished in Ol. LX. (540-537 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), and
Diels holds that Apollodoros really said so.<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c014'><sup>[269]</sup></a> However
that may be, it is evident that the date 540 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
is based on the assumption that he went to Elea in
the year of its foundation, and is, therefore, a mere
combination.<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c014'><sup>[270]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>What we do know for certain is that Xenophanes
had led a wandering life from the age of twenty-five,
and that he was still alive and making poetry at the
age of ninety-two. He says himself (fr. 8 = 24 Karst.;
R. P. 97):—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>There are by this time threescore years and seven that
have tossed my careworn soul<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c014'><sup>[271]</sup></a> up and down the land of
Hellas; and there were then five-and-twenty years from my
birth, if I can say aught truly about these matters.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>It is tempting to suppose that in this passage
Xenophanes was referring to the conquest of Ionia by
Harpagos, and that he is, in fact, answering the question
asked in another poem<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c014'><sup>[272]</sup></a> (fr. 22 = 17 Karst.; R. P.
95 a):—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>This is the sort of thing we should say by the fireside in
the winter-time, as we lie on soft couches after a good
meal, drinking sweet wine and crunching chickpeas: “Of
what country are you, and how old are you, good sir? And
how old were you when the Mede appeared?”</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>We cannot, however, be sure of this, and we must
be content with what is, after all, for our purpose the
main fact, namely, that he refers to Pythagoras in the
past tense, and is in turn so referred to by Herakleitos.<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c014'><sup>[273]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Theophrastos said that Xenophanes had “heard”
Anaximander,<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c014'><sup>[274]</sup></a> and we shall see that he was certainly
acquainted with the Ionian cosmology. When driven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>from his native city, he lived in Sicily, chiefly, we are
told, at Zankle and Katana.<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c014'><sup>[275]</sup></a> Like Archilochos before
him, he unburdened his soul in elegies and satires, which
he recited at the banquets where, we may suppose, the
refugees tried to keep up the usages of good Ionian
society. The statement that he was a rhapsode has
no foundation at all.<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c014'><sup>[276]</sup></a> The singer of elegies was no
professional like the rhapsode, but the social equal of
his listeners. In his ninety-second year he was still,
we have seen, leading a wandering life, which is hardly
consistent with the statement that he settled at Elea
and founded a school there, especially if we are to think
of him as spending his last days at Hieron’s court. It
is quite probable that he visited Elea, and it is just
possible that he wrote a poem of two thousand hexameters
on the foundation of that city, which was
naturally a subject of interest to all the Ionic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>émigrés</i></span>.<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c014'><sup>[277]</sup></a>
But it is very remarkable that no ancient writer expressly
says that he ever was at Elea, and the only thing
besides the doubtful poem referred to which connects
him with it is a single anecdote of Aristotle’s as to the
answer he gave the Eleates when they asked whether
they should sacrifice to Leukothea and lament her or
not. “If you think her a goddess,” he said, “do not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>lament her; if not, do not sacrifice to her.” That is
absolutely all, and it is only an apophthegm.<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c014'><sup>[278]</sup></a> It
is strange there should be no more if Xenophanes
had really found a home at last in the Phokaian
colony.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Poems.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec56'></a>56. According to a notice preserved in Diogenes,
Xenophanes wrote in hexameters and also composed
elegies and iambics against Homer and Hesiod.<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c014'><sup>[279]</sup></a> No
good authority says anything about his having written
a philosophical poem.<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c014'><sup>[280]</sup></a> Simplicius tells us he had never
met with the verses about the earth stretching infinitely
downwards (fr. <a href='#Xe.28'>28</a>),<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c014'><sup>[281]</sup></a> and this means that the Academy
possessed no copy of such a poem, which would be very
strange if it had ever existed. Simplicius was able to
find the complete works of much smaller men. Nor does
internal evidence lend any support to the view that he
wrote a philosophical poem. Diels refers about twenty-eight
lines to it, but they would all come in quite
as naturally in his attacks on Homer and Hesiod, as I
have endeavoured to show. It is also significant that a
considerable number of them are derived from commentators
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>on Homer.<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c014'><sup>[282]</sup></a> It seems probable, then, that
Xenophanes expressed his theological and philosophical
views incidentally in his satires. That would be quite
in the manner of the time, as we can see from the
remains of Epicharmos.</p>

<p class='c002'>The satires themselves are called <cite>Silloi</cite> by late writers,
and this name may go back to Xenophanes himself.
It is also possible, however, that it originates in the
fact that Timon of Phleious, the “sillographer” (<i>c.</i> 259
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), put much of his satire upon philosophers into the
mouth of Xenophanes. Only one iambic line has been
preserved, and that is immediately followed by a hexameter
(fr. <a href='#Xe.14'>14</a> = 5 Karst.). This suggests that Xenophanes
inserted iambic lines among his hexameters in
the manner of the <cite>Margites</cite>, which would be a very
natural thing for him to do.<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c014'><sup>[283]</sup></a></p>

fitting to set strength before our art. Even if there arise a

<p class='c002'><a id='sec58'></a>58. The intention of one of these fragments (fr. <a href='#Xe.32'>32</a>)
is perfectly clear. “Iris too” is a cloud, and we may
infer that the same thing had just been said of the sun,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>moon, and stars; for the doxographers tell us that these
were all explained as “clouds ignited by motion.”<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c014'><sup>[290]</sup></a> To
the same context clearly belongs the explanation of the
St. Elmo’s fire which Aetios has preserved. “The
things like stars which appear on ships,” we are told,
“which some call the Dioskouroi, are little clouds made
luminous by motion.”<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c014'><sup>[291]</sup></a> In the doxographers this
explanation is repeated with trifling variations under
the head of moon, stars, comets, lightning, shooting
stars, and so forth, which gives the appearance of a
systematic cosmology.<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c014'><sup>[292]</sup></a> But the system is due to the
arrangement of the work of Theophrastos, and not to
Xenophanes; for it is obvious that a very few hexameters
added to those we possess would amply account
for the whole doxography.</p>

<p class='c002'>What we hear of the sun presents some difficulties.
We are told, on the one hand, that it too was an ignited
cloud; but this can hardly be right. The evaporation
of the sea from which clouds arise is distinctly said to
be due to the sun’s heat. Theophrastos stated that the
sun, according to Xenophanes, was a collection of sparks
from the moist exhalation; but even this leaves the
exhalation itself unexplained.<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c014'><sup>[293]</sup></a> That, however, matters
little, if the chief aim of Xenophanes was to discredit
the anthropomorphic gods, rather than to give a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>scientific theory of the heavenly bodies. The important
thing is that Helios too is a temporary phenomenon.
The sun does not go round the earth, as Anaximander
taught, but straight on, and the appearance of
a circular path is solely due to its increasing distance.
So it is not the same sun that rises next morning, but
a new one altogether; while the old one “tumbles into
a hole” when it comes to certain uninhabited regions
of the earth. Besides that, there are many suns and
moons, one of each for every region of the earth.<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c014'><sup>[294]</sup></a> It
is obvious that things of that kind cannot be gods.</p>

<p class='c002'>The vigorous expression “tumbling into a hole”<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c014'><sup>[295]</sup></a>
seems clearly to come from the verses of Xenophanes
himself, and there are others of a similar kind, which
we must suppose were quoted by Theophrastos. The
stars go out in the daytime, but glow again at night
“like charcoal embers.”<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c014'><sup>[296]</sup></a> The sun is of some use in
producing the world and the living creatures in it, but
the moon “does no work in the boat.”<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c014'><sup>[297]</sup></a> Such expressions
can only be meant to make the heavenly
bodies appear ridiculous, and it will therefore be well to
ask whether the other supposed cosmological fragments
can be interpreted on the same principle.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Earth and water.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span><a id='sec59'></a>59. In fr. <a href='#Xe.29'>29</a> Xenophanes says that “all things are
earth and water,” and Hippolytos has preserved the
account given by Theophrastos of the context in which
this occurred. It was as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Xenophanes said that a mixture of the earth with the sea
is taking place, and that it is being gradually dissolved by the
moisture. He says that he has the following proofs of this.
Shells are found in midland districts and on hills, and he says
that in the quarries at Syracuse has been found the imprint of
a fish and of seaweed, at Paros the form of an anchovy in the
depth of the stone, and at Malta flat impressions of all marine
animals. These, he says, were produced when all things were
formerly mud, and the outlines were dried in the mud. All
human beings are destroyed when the earth has been carried
down into the sea and turned to mud. This change takes
place for all the worlds.—Hipp. <cite>Ref.</cite> i. 14 (R. P. 103 a).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>This is, of course, the theory of Anaximander, and
we may perhaps credit him rather than Xenophanes
with the observations of fossils.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c014'><sup>[298]</sup></a> Most remarkable of
all, however, is the statement that this change applies to
“all the worlds.” It really seems impossible to doubt
that Theophrastos attributed a belief in “innumerable
worlds” to Xenophanes. As we have seen already,
Aetios includes him in his list of those who held this
doctrine, and Diogenes ascribes it to him also.<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c014'><sup>[299]</sup></a> In
this place, Hippolytos seems to take it for granted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>We shall also find, however, that in another connexion
he said the World or God was one. If our interpretation
of him is correct, there is no difficulty here. The
main point is that, so far from being a primeval goddess,
and “a sure seat for all things ever,” Gaia too is a
passing appearance. That belongs to the attack upon
Hesiod, and, if in this connexion Xenophanes spoke,
with Anaximander, of “innumerable worlds,” while
elsewhere he said that God or the World was one,
that is probably connected with a still better attested
contradiction which we have now to examine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Finite or infinite?</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec60'></a>60. Aristotle tried without success to discover from
the poems of Xenophanes whether he regarded the
world as finite or infinite. “He made no clear pronouncement
on the subject,” he tells us.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c014'><sup>[300]</sup></a> Theophrastos,
on the other hand, decided that he regarded it as
spherical and finite because he said it was “equal every
way.”<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c014'><sup>[301]</sup></a> This, however, leads to very serious difficulties.
We have seen already that Xenophanes said the sun
went right on to infinity, and this agrees with his view
of the earth as an infinitely extended plain. Still
more difficult to reconcile with the idea of a spherical
and finite world is the statement of fr. <a href='#Xe.28'>28</a> that, while
the earth has an upper limit which we see, it has no
limit below. This is attested by Aristotle, who speaks
of the earth being “infinitely rooted,” and adds that
Empedokles criticised Xenophanes for holding this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>view.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c014'><sup>[302]</sup></a> It further appears from the fragment of
Empedokles quoted by Aristotle that Xenophanes said
the vast Air extended infinitely upwards.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c014'><sup>[303]</sup></a> We are
therefore bound to try to find room for an infinite
earth and an infinite air in a spherical and finite world!
That comes of trying to find science in satire. If, on
the other hand, we regard these statements from the
same point of view as those about the heavenly bodies,
we shall at once see what they most probably mean.
The story of Ouranos and Gaia was always the chief
scandal of the <cite>Theogony</cite>, and the infinite air gets rid of
Ouranos altogether. As to the earth stretching
infinitely downwards, that gets rid of Tartaros, which
Homer described as situated at the bottommost limit
of earth and sea, as far beneath Hades as heaven is
above the earth.<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c014'><sup>[304]</sup></a> This is pure conjecture, of course;
but, if it is even possible, we are entitled to disbelieve
that such startling contradictions occurred in a
cosmological poem.</p>

<p class='c002'>A more subtle explanation of the difficulty
commended itself to the late Peripatetic who wrote an
account of the Eleatic school, part of which is still
extant in the Aristotelian corpus, and is generally
known now as the treatise on <cite>Melissos, Xenophanes, and
Gorgias</cite>.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c014'><sup>[305]</sup></a> He said that Xenophanes declared the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>world to be neither finite nor infinite, and he composed
a series of arguments in support of this thesis, to
which he added another like it, namely, that the world
is neither in motion nor at rest. This has introduced
endless confusion into our sources. Alexander used
this treatise as well as the great work of Theophrastos,
and Simplicius supposed the quotations from it to be
from Theophrastos too. Having no copy of the poems
he was completely baffled, and until recently all accounts
of Xenophanes were vitiated by the same confusion.
It may even be suggested that, but for this, we
should have heard very little of the “philosophy of
Xenophanes,” a way of speaking which is in the main
a survival from the days before this scholastic exercise
was recognised as having no authority.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>God and the world.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec61'></a>61. In the passage of the <cite>Metaphysics</cite> just referred
to, Aristotle speaks of Xenophanes as “the first
partisan of the One,”<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c014'><sup>[306]</sup></a> and the context shows that
he means to suggest he was the first of the Eleatics.
We have seen already that the certain facts of his life
make it very unlikely that he settled at Elea and
founded a school there, and it is probable that, as
usual in such cases, Aristotle is simply reproducing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>certain statements of Plato. At any rate, Plato had
spoken of the Eleatics as the “partisans of the
Whole,”<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c014'><sup>[307]</sup></a> and he had also spoken of the school as
“starting with Xenophanes and even earlier.”<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c014'><sup>[308]</sup></a> The
last words, however, show clearly enough what he
meant. Just as he called the Herakleiteans “followers
of Homer and still more ancient teachers,”<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c014'><sup>[309]</sup></a> so he
attached the Eleatic school to Xenophanes and still
earlier authorities. We have seen in other instances
how these playful and ironical remarks of Plato were
taken seriously by his successors, and we need not let
this fresh instance of the same thing influence our
general view of Xenophanes unduly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle goes on to tell us that Xenophanes,
“referring to the whole world,<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c014'><sup>[310]</sup></a> said the One was god.”
This clearly alludes to frs. <a href='#Xe.23'>23-26</a>, where all human
attributes are denied of a god who is said to be one
and “the greatest among gods and men.” It may be
added that these verses gain very much in point if we
may think of them as closely connected with frs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span><a href='#Xe.11'>11-16</a>, instead of referring the one set of verses to the
Satires and the other to a cosmological poem. It was
probably in the same context that Xenophanes called
the world or god “equal every way”<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c014'><sup>[311]</sup></a> and denied that
it breathed.<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c014'><sup>[312]</sup></a> The statement that, there is no mastership
among the gods<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c014'><sup>[313]</sup></a> also goes very well with fr. <a href='#Xe.26'>26</a>.
A god has no wants, nor is it fitting for one god to be
the servant of others, like Iris and Hermes in Homer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Monotheism or polytheism.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec62'></a>62. That this “god” is just the world, Aristotle
tells us, and the use of the word θεός is quite in
accordance with Anaximander’s. Xenophanes regarded
it as sentient, though without any special organs of
sense, and it sways all things by the thought of its
mind. He also calls it “one god,” and, if that is
monotheism, then Xenophanes was a monotheist,
though this is surely not how the word is generally
understood. The fact is that the expression “one
god” wakens all sorts of associations in our mind
which did not exist at all for the Greeks of this time.
His contemporaries would have been more likely to
call Xenophanes an atheist than anything else. As
Eduard Meyer excellently says: “In Greece the question
of one god or gods many hardly plays any part.
Whether the divine power is thought of as a unity
or a plurality, is irrelevant in comparison with the
question whether it exists at all, and how its nature
and its relation to the world is to be understood.”<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c014'><sup>[314]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>On the other hand, it is wrong to say with Freudenthal
that Xenophanes was in any sense a polytheist.<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c014'><sup>[315]</sup></a>
That he should use the language of polytheism in his
elegies is only what we should expect, and the other
references to “gods” can be best explained as incidental
to his attack on the anthropomorphic gods of Homer
and Hesiod. In one case, Freudenthal has pressed a
proverbial way of speaking too hard.<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c014'><sup>[316]</sup></a> Least of all
can we admit that Xenophanes allowed the existence
of subordinate or departmental gods; for it was just
the existence of such that he was chiefly concerned
to deny. At the same time, I cannot help thinking that
Freudenthal was more nearly right than Wilamowitz,
who says that Xenophanes “upheld the only real
monotheism that has ever existed upon earth.”<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c014'><sup>[317]</sup></a> Diels,
I fancy, comes nearer the mark, when he calls it a
“somewhat narrow pantheism.”<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c014'><sup>[318]</sup></a> But all these views
would have surprised Xenophanes himself about equally.
He was really Goethe’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Weltkind</cite></span>, with prophets to
right and left of him, and he would have smiled if
he had known that one day he was to be regarded
as a theologian.</p>

which the Tyrrhenian “Pelasgians” were expelled by Miltiades (Herod. vi.

There were also Tyrrhenians at Imbros. This explains the story that he

that these were divulged by Hippasos; but the most reasonable view is
that there were no secrets at all except of a ritual kind.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#r202'>202</a>. Plato, <cite>Rep.</cite> x. 600 a, implies that Pythagoras held no public office.
The view that the Pythagorean sect was a political league, maintained in
modern times by Krische (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De societatis a Pythagora conditae scopo politico</cite></span>,
1830), goes back, as Rohde has shown (<i>loc. cit.</i>), to Dikaiarchos, the
champion of the “Practical Life,” just as the view that it was primarily a
scientific society goes back to the mathematician and musician Aristoxenos.
The former antedated Archytas, just as the latter antedated Philolaos (see
Chap. VII. <a href='#sec138'>§ 138</a>). Grote’s good sense enabled him to see this quite clearly
(vol. iv. pp. 329 sqq.).</p>

to insist upon this, as the idea that the Pythagoreans represented the
“Dorian ideal” dies very hard. In his <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Kulturhistorische Beiträge</cite></span> (Heft
i. p. 59), Max C. P. Schmidt imagines that later writers call the founder
of the sect Pythagoras instead of Pythagores, as he is called by Herakleitos
and Demokritos, because he had become “a Dorian of the Dorians.”
The fact is simply that Πυθαγόρας is the Attic form of Πυθαγόρης, and
that the writers in question wrote Attic. Similarly, Plato calls Archytas,
who did belong to a Dorian state, Archytes, though Aristoxenos and others
retained the Dorian form of his name.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f204'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r204'>204</a>. Kylon, the chief opponent of the Pythagoreans, is described by
Aristoxenos (Iambl. <cite>V. Pyth.</cite> 248) as γένει καὶ δόξῃ καὶ πλούτῳ πρωτεύων
τῶν πολιτῶν. Taras, later the chief seat of the Pythagoreans, was a
democracy. The truth is that, at this time, the new religion appealed to
the people rather than the aristocracies, which were apt to be “free-thinking”
(Meyer, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gesch. des Alt.</cite></span> iii. § 252). Xenophanes, not Pythagoras,
is their man.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f205'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r205'>205</a>. We have the authority of Aristotle, fr. 186, 1510 b 20, for the identification
of Pythagoras with Apollo Hyperboreios. The names of Abaris and
Aristeas stand for a mystical movement parallel to the Orphic, but based
on the worship of Apollo. The later tradition makes them predecessors of
Pythagoras; and that this has some historical basis, appears from Herod.
iv. 13 sqq., and above all from the statement that Aristeas had a statue at
Metapontion, where Pythagoras died. The connexion of Pythagoras with
Zamolxis belongs to the same order of ideas. As the legend of the Hyperboreans
is Delian, we see that the religion taught by Pythagoras was
genuinely Ionian in its origin.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f206'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r206'>206</a>. See Rohde, <cite>Rh. Mus.</cite> xxvi. p. 565, n. 1. The narrative in the text
(Iambl. <cite>V. Pyth.</cite> 250; R. P. 59 b) goes back to Aristoxenos and
Dikaiarchos (R. P. 59 a). There is no reason to suppose that their view of
Pythagoras has vitiated their account of what must have been a perfectly
well-known piece of history. According to the later story, Pythagoras
himself was burned to death in the house of Milo, along with his disciples.
This is merely a dramatic compression of the whole series of events into a
single scene; we have seen that Pythagoras died at Metapontion before the
final catastrophe. The valuable reference in Polybios ii. 39 (R. P. 59) to
the burning of Pythagorean συνέδρια certainly implies that the disturbances
went on for a very considerable time.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f208'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r208'>208</a>. When discussing the Pythagorean system, Aristotle always refers it to
“the Pythagoreans,” not to Pythagoras himself. That this was intentional
seems to be proved by the phrase οἱ καλούμενοι Πυθαγόρειοι, which occurs
more than once (<i>e.g.</i> <cite>Met.</cite> Α, 5. 985 b 23; <cite>de Caelo</cite>, Β, 13. 293 a 20).
Pythagoras himself is only thrice mentioned in the whole Aristotelian corpus,
and in only one of these places (<cite>M. Mor.</cite> 1182 a 11) is any philosophical
doctrine ascribed to him. We are told there that he was the first to discuss
the subject of goodness, and that he made the mistake of identifying its
various forms with numbers. But this is just one of the things which prove
the late date of the <cite>Magna Moralia</cite>. Aristotle himself is quite clear that
what he knew as the Pythagorean system belonged in the main to the days
of Empedokles, Anaxagoras, and Leukippos; for, after mentioning these,
he goes on to describe the Pythagoreans as “contemporary with and earlier
than them” (ἐν δὲ τούτοις καὶ πρὸ τούτων, <cite>Met.</cite> Α, 5. 985 b 23).</p>

Aristoxenos may be right about the taboo on beans. We know that it

mistake. That, however, would not affect the general conclusion that at

<p class='c002'><a href='#r217'>217</a>. The sect of the “Akousmatics” was said to descend from Hippasos
(Iambl. <cite>V. Pyth.</cite> 81; R. P. 56). Now Hippasos was the author of a

<p class='c002'><a href='#r218'>218</a>. Diels has collected these fragments in a convenient form (<cite>Vors.</cite> pp. 291

Kock, ὥσπερ Πυθαγορίζων ἐσθίει | ἔμψυχον οὐδέν; Alexis, fr. 220, οἱ Πυθαγορίζοντες

<p class='c002'><a href='#r219'>219</a>. See Bernays, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Theophrastos’ Schrift über Frömmigkeit</cite></span>. Porphyry’s
tract, Περὶ ἀποχῆς ἐμψύχων, was doubtless saved from the general destruction
of his writings by its conformity to the ascetic tendencies of the age.
Even St. Jerome made constant use of it in his polemic against Iovianus,
though he is careful not to mention Porphyry’s name (<cite>Theophr. Schr.</cite> n. 2).
The tract is addressed to Castricius Firmus, the disciple and friend of
Plotinos, who had fallen away from the strict vegetarianism of the
Pythagoreans.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f220'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r220'>220</a>. The passage occurs <cite>De Abst.</cite> p. 58, 25 Nauck: ἱστοροῦσι δέ τινες καὶ
αὐτοὺς ἅπτεσθαι τῶν ἐμψύχων τοὺς Πυθαγορείους, ὅτε θύοιεν θεοῖς. The
part of the work from which this is taken comes from one Clodius, on
whom see Bernay, <cite>Theophr. Schr.</cite> p. 11. He was probably the rhetorician
Sextus Clodius, and a contemporary of Cicero. Bernays has shown that he
made use of the work of Herakleides of Pontos (<i>ib.</i> n. 19). On “mystic

<p class='c002'><a href='#r221'>221</a>. Porphyry (<cite>V. Pyth.</cite> c 15) has preserved a tradition to the effect that
Pythagoras recommended a flesh diet for athletes (Milo?). This story
must have originated at the same time as those related by Aristoxenos,
and in a similar way. In fact, Bernays has shown that it comes from
Herakleides of Pontos (<cite>Theophr. Schr.</cite> n. 8). Iamblichos (<cite>V. Pyth.</cite> 5. 25)
and others (Diog. viii. 13, 47) got out of this by supposing it referred to a
gymnast of the same name. We see here very distinctly how the
Neoplatonists for their own ends endeavoured to go back to the original
form of the Pythagorean legend, and to explain away the fourth century
reconstruction.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f229'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r229'>229</a>. See Döring in <cite>Arch.</cite> v. pp. 505 sqq. There seems to be a reference to
the theory of the “three lives” in Herakleitos, fr. <a href='#He.111'>111</a>. It was apparently
taught in the Pythagorean Society of Phleious; for Herakleides made
Pythagoras expound it in a conversation with the tyrant of Phleious
(Cic. <cite>Tusc.</cite> v. 3; Diog. pr. 12, viii. 8), and it is developed by Plato in a
dialogue which is, as it were, dedicated to Echekrates. If it should be
thought that this is interpreting Pythagoras too much in the light of
Schopenhauer, it may be answered that even the Orphics came very near
such a theory. The soul must not drink of Lethe, but go past it and
drink of the water of Memory, before it can claim to become one of the
heroes. This has obvious points of contact with Plato’s ἀνάμνησις, and the
only question is how much of the <cite>Phaedo</cite> we are to ascribe to Pythagorean
sources. A great deal, I suspect. See Prof. Stewart’s <cite>Myths of Plato</cite>,

which have been given of the words καὶ χωρίς in the Aristotelian passage
(see Zeller, p. 351, n. 2), and I would therefore suggest ταῖς χώραις comparing
Boutheros (Stob. i. p. 19, 9), who says, according to the MS. reading,
Καὶ ὁ μὲν (ὁ περισσός), ὁπόταν γεννῶνται ἀνὰ λόγον καὶ πρὸς μονάδας,

three sections: (1) Περὶ Ζήνωνος, (2) Περὶ Ξενοφάνους, (3) Περὶ Γοργίου.
The first section, however, plainly refers to Melissos, so the whole treatise
is now entitled <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia</cite></span> (<cite>M.X.G.</cite>). It has been
edited by Apelt in the Teubner Series, and more recently by Diels (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Abh.
der k. Preuss. Akad.</cite></span> 1900), who has also given the section dealing with
Xenophanes in <cite>P. Ph. Fr.</cite> pp. 24-29 (<cite>Vors.</cite> pp. 36 sqq.). He has now
withdrawn the view maintained in <cite>Dox.</cite> p. 108 that the work belongs to
the third century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and holds that it was <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a Peripatetico eclectico</span> (i.e.
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sceptica, platonica, stoica admiscente) circa Christi natalem conscriptum</span></i>.
If that is so, there is no reason to doubt, as I formerly did, that the
second section is really meant to deal with Xenophanes. The writer would
have no first-hand knowledge of his poems, and the order in which the
philosophers are discussed is that of the passage in the <cite>Metaphysics</cite> which
suggested the whole thing. It is possible that a section on Parmenides
preceded what we now have.</p>

occurs nowhere else, but is plainly formed on the analogy of μηδίζειν,
φιλιππίζειν, and the like. It is not likely that it means “to unify.”

and such a formation would be against all analogy. The derivation
στασιώτας ... ἀπὸ τῆς στάσεως appears first in Sext. <cite>Math.</cite> x. 46, from

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III <br /> HERAKLEITOS OF EPHESOS</h2>
</div>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Life of Herakleitos.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec63'></a>63. Herakleitos of Ephesos, son of Blyson, is said to
have “flourished” in Ol. LXIX. (504/3-501/0 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>);<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c014'><sup>[319]</sup></a>
that is to say, just in the middle of the reign of
Dareios, with whom several traditions connected him.<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c014'><sup>[320]</sup></a>
We shall see that Parmenides was assigned to the same
Olympiad, though for another reason (<a href='#sec84'>§ 84</a>). It is more
important, however, for our purpose to notice that, while
Herakleitos refers to Pythagoras and Xenophanes by
name and in the past tense (fr. <a href='#Xe.16'>16</a>), he is in turn
referred to by Parmenides (fr. 6). These references
are sufficient to mark his proper place in the history
of philosophy. Zeller holds, indeed, that he cannot
have published his work till after 478 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, on the
ground that the expulsion of his friend Hermodoros,
alluded to in fr. <a href='#He.114'>114</a>, could not have taken place
before the downfall of Persian rule.  If that were
so, it might be hard to see how Parmenides could
have known the views of Herakleitos; but there is
surely no difficulty in supposing that the Ephesians
may have sent one of their foremost citizens into
banishment at a time when they were still paying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>tribute to the Great King. The Persians never took
their internal self-government from the Ionian cities,
and the spurious <cite>Letters</cite> of Herakleitos show the
accepted view was that the expulsion of Hermodoros
took place during the reign of Dareios.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c014'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Sotion said that Herakleitos was a disciple of
Xenophanes,<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c014'><sup>[322]</sup></a> which is not probable; for Xenophanes
seems to have left Ionia for ever before Herakleitos
was born. More likely he was not a disciple of
any one; but it is clear, at the same time, that he
was acquainted both with the Milesian cosmology
and with the poems of Xenophanes. He also
knew something of the theories taught by Pythagoras
(fr. <a href='#He.17'>17</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>Of the life of Herakleitos we really know nothing,
except, perhaps, that he belonged to the ancient royal
house and resigned the nominal position of Basileus
in favour of his brother.<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c014'><sup>[323]</sup></a> The origin of the other
statements bearing on it is quite transparent.<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c014'><sup>[324]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>His book.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec64'></a>64. We do not know the title of the work of
Herakleitos<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c014'><sup>[325]</sup></a>—if, indeed, it had one at all—and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>is not very easy to form a clear idea of its contents.
We are told that it was divided into three discourses:
one dealing with the universe, one political, and one
theological.<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c014'><sup>[326]</sup></a> It is not likely that this division is
due to Herakleitos himself; all we can infer from the
statement is that the work fell naturally into these
three parts when the Stoic commentators took their
editions of it in hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>The style of Herakleitos is proverbially obscure,
and, at a later date, got him the nickname of “the
Dark.”<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c014'><sup>[327]</sup></a> Now the fragments about the Delphic god
and the Sibyl (frs. <a href='#He.11'>11</a> and <a href='#He.12'>12</a>) seem to show that
he was quite conscious of writing an oracular style,
and we have to ask why he did so. In the first place,
it was the manner of the time.<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c014'><sup>[328]</sup></a> The stirring events
of the age, and the influence of the religious revival,
gave something of a prophetic tone to all the leaders
of thought. Pindar and Aischylos have it too. They
all feel that they are in some measure inspired. It is
also the age of great individualities, who are apt to be
solitary and disdainful. Herakleitos at least was so.
If men cared to dig for the gold they might find it
(fr. <a href='#He.8'>8</a>); if not, they must be content with straw (fr.
<a href='#He.51'>51</a>). This seems to have been the view taken by
Theophrastos, who said that the headstrong temperament
of Herakleitos sometimes led him into incompleteness
and inconsistencies of statement.<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c014'><sup>[329]</sup></a> But that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>a very different thing from studied obscurity and the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>disciplina arcani</i></span> sometimes attributed to him; if
Herakleitos does not go out of his way to make his
meaning clear, neither does he hide it (fr. <a href='#He.11'>11</a>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The fragments.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec65'></a>65. I give a version of the fragments according to
the arrangement of Mr. Bywater’s exemplary edition.<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c014'><sup>[330]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>(1) It is wise to hearken, not to me, but to my Word, and
to confess that all things are one.<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c014'><sup>[331]</sup></a> R. P. 40.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='He.2'></a>(2) Though this Word<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c014'><sup>[332]</sup></a> is true evermore, yet men are as
unable to understand it when they hear it for the first time as
before they have heard it at all. For, though all things come
to pass in accordance with this Word, men seem as if they
had no experience of them, when they make trial of words and
deeds such as I set forth, dividing each thing according to its
nature and showing how it truly is. But other men know not
what they are doing when awake, even as they forget what they
do in sleep. R. P. 32.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>(3) Fools when they do hear are like the deaf: of them
does the saying bear witness that they are absent when
present. R. P. 31 a.</p>

<p class='c002'>(4) Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to men if they have
souls that understand not their language. R. P. 42.</p>

<p class='c002'>(5) The many do not take heed of such things as those
they meet with, nor do they mark them when they are taught,
though they think they do.</p>

<p class='c002'>(6) Knowing not how to listen nor how to speak.</p>

<p class='c002'>(7) If you do not expect the unexpected, you will not find
it; for it is hard to be sought out and difficult.<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c014'><sup>[333]</sup></a></p>

nor hides his meaning, but shows it by a sign. R. P. 30 a.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='He.12'></a>(12) And the Sibyl, with raving lips uttering things mirthless,
unbedizened, and unperfumed, reaches over a thousand
years with her voice, thanks to the god in her. R. P. 30 a.</p>

<p class='c002'>(13) The things that can be seen, heard, and learned are
what I prize the most. R. P. 42.</p>

<p class='c002'>(14) ... bringing untrustworthy witnesses in support of
disputed points.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='He.16'></a>(16) The learning of many things teacheth not understanding,
else would it have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and
again Xenophanes and Hekataios. R. P. 31.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='He.17'></a>(17) Pythagoras, son of Mnesarchos, practised inquiry
beyond all other men, and choosing out these writings, claimed
for his own wisdom what was but a knowledge of many
things and an art of mischief.<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c014'><sup>[335]</sup></a> R. P. 31 a.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span><a id='He.18'></a>(18) Of all whose discourses I have heard, there is not one
who attains to understanding that wisdom is apart from all.

R. P. 36 a.</p>

<p class='c002'>(27) How can one hide from that which never sets?</p>

things. R. P. 35 b.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='He.29'></a>(29) The sun will not overstep his measures; if he does,

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The doxographical tradition.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec66'></a>66. It will be seen that some of these fragments
are far from clear, and there are probably not a few of
which the meaning will never be recovered. We
naturally turn, then, to the doxographers for a clue;
but, as ill-luck will have it, they are far less instructive
with regard to Herakleitos than we have found them
in other cases. We have, in fact, two great difficulties
to contend with. The first is the unusual weakness of
the doxographical tradition itself. Hippolytos, upon
whom we can generally rely for a fairly accurate
account of what Theophrastos really said, derived the
material for his first four chapters, which treat of
Thales, Pythagoras, Herakleitos, and Empedokles, not
from the excellent epitome which he afterwards used,
but from a biographical compendium,<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c014'><sup>[366]</sup></a> which consisted
for the most part of apocryphal anecdotes and apophthegms.
It was based, further, on some writer of
<cite>Successions</cite> who regarded Herakleitos and Empedokles
as Pythagoreans. They are therefore placed side
by side, and their doctrines are hopelessly mixed up
together. The link between Herakleitos and the
Pythagoreans was Hippasos of Metapontion, in whose
system, as we know, fire played an important part.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Theophrastos, following Aristotle, had spoken of the
two in the same sentence, and this was enough to put
the writers of <cite>Successions</cite> off the track.<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c014'><sup>[367]</sup></a> We are forced,
then, to look to the more detailed of the two accounts
of the opinions of Herakleitos given in Diogenes,<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c014'><sup>[368]</sup></a> which
goes back to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vetusta Placita</cite></span>, and is, fortunately,
pretty full and accurate. All our other sources are
more or less tainted.</p>

<p class='c002'>The second difficulty which we have to face is
even more serious. Most of the commentators on
Herakleitos mentioned in Diogenes were Stoics,<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c014'><sup>[369]</sup></a> and
it is certain that their paraphrases were sometimes
taken for the original. Now, the Stoics held the
Ephesian in peculiar veneration, and sought to
interpret him as far as possible in accordance with
their own system. Further, they were fond of “accommodating”<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c014'><sup>[370]</sup></a>
the views of earlier thinkers to their own,
and this has had serious consequences. In particular,
the Stoic theories of the λόγος and the ἐκπύρωσις are
constantly ascribed to Herakleitos by our authorities,
and the very fragments are adulterated with scraps of
Stoic terminology.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The discovery of Herakleitos.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec67'></a>67. Herakleitos looks down not only on the mass
of men, but on all previous inquirers into nature.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>This must mean that he believed himself to have
attained insight into some truth which had not
hitherto been recognised, though it was, as it were,
staring men in the face (fr. <a href='#He.93'>93</a>). Clearly, then, if we
wish to get at the central thing in his teaching, we
must try to find out what he was thinking of when he
launched into those denunciations of human dulness
and ignorance.<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c014'><sup>[371]</sup></a> The answer seems to be given in two
fragments, <a href='#He.18'>18</a> and <a href='#He.45'>45</a>. From them we gather that
the truth hitherto ignored is that the many apparently
independent and conflicting things we know are really
one, and that, on the other hand, this one is also many.
The “strife of opposites” is really an “attunement”
(ἁρμονία). From this it follows that wisdom is not
a knowledge of many things, but the perception of the
underlying unity of the warring opposites. That this
really was the fundamental thought of Herakleitos is
stated by Philo. He says: “For that which is made
up of both the opposites is one; and, when the one is
divided, the opposites are disclosed. Is not this just
what the Greeks say their great and much belauded
Herakleitos put in the forefront of his philosophy as
summing it all up, and boasted of as a new discovery?”<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c014'><sup>[372]</sup></a>
We shall take the elements of this theory
one by one, and see how they are to be understood.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The One and the Many.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec68'></a>68. Anaximander had taught already that the
opposites were separated out from the Boundless, but
passed away into it once more, so paying the penalty
for their unjust encroachments on one another. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>here implied that there is something wrong in the war
of opposites, and that the existence of the Many is a
breach in the unity of the One. The truth which
Herakleitos proclaimed was that there is no One
without the Many, and no Many without the One.
The world is at once one and many, and it is just the
“opposite tension” of the Many that constitutes the
unity of the One.</p>

<p class='c002'>The credit of having been the first to see this is
expressly assigned to Herakleitos by Plato. In the
<cite>Sophist</cite> (242 d), the Eleatic stranger, after explaining
how the Eleatics maintained that what we call many
is really one, proceeds:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>But certain Ionian and (at a later date) certain Sicilian
Muses remarked that it was safest to unite these two things,
and to say that reality is both many and one, and is kept
together by Hate and Love. “For,” say the more severe
Muses, “in its division it is always being brought together”
(cf. fr. <a href='#He.59'>59</a>); while the softer Muses relaxed the requirement
that this should always be so, and said that the All was
alternately one and at peace through the power of Aphrodite,
and many and at war with itself because of something they
called Strife.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>In this passage the Ionian Muses stand, of course,
for Herakleitos, and the Sicilian for Empedokles. We
remark also that the differentiation of the one into
many, and the integration of the many into one, are
both eternal and simultaneous, and that this is the
ground upon which the system of Herakleitos is contrasted
with that of Empedokles. We shall come
back to that point again. Meanwhile we confine ourselves
to this, that, according to Plato, Herakleitos
taught that reality was at once many and one.</p>

<p class='c002'>We must be careful, however, not to imagine that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>what Herakleitos thus discovered was a logical principle.
This was the mistake of Lassalle’s book.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c014'><sup>[373]</sup></a> The identity
in and through difference which he proclaimed was
purely physical; logic did not yet exist, and as the
principle of identity had not been formulated, it would
have been impossible to protest against an abstract
application of it. The identity which he explains as
consisting in difference is simply that of the primary
substance in all its manifestations. This identity had
been realised already by the Milesians, but they had
found a difficulty in the difference. Anaximander had
treated the strife of opposites as an “injustice,” and
what Herakleitos set himself to show was that, on the
contrary, it was the highest justice (fr. <a href='#He.62'>62</a>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Fire.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec69'></a>69. All this made it necessary for him to seek out a
new primary substance. He wanted not merely something
out of which the diversified world we know might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>conceivably be made, or from which opposites could be
“separated out,” but something which of its own nature
would pass into everything else, while everything else
would pass in turn into it. This he found in Fire, and
it is easy to see why, if we consider the phenomenon
of combustion, even as it appears to the plain man.
The quantity of fire in a flame burning steadily appears
to remain the same, the flame seems to be what we
call a “thing.” And yet the substance of it is continually
changing. It is always passing away in
smoke, and its place is always being taken by fresh
matter from the fuel that feeds it. This is just what
we want. If we regard the world as an “ever-living
fire” (fr. <a href='#He.20'>20</a>), we can understand how it is always
becoming all things, while all things are always returning
to it.<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c014'><sup>[374]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Flux.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec70'></a>70. This necessarily brings with it a certain way of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>looking at the change and movement of the world.
Fire burns continuously and without interruption. It
is therefore always consuming fuel and always liberating
smoke. Everything is either mounting upwards to
serve as fuel, or sinking downwards after having
nourished the flame. It follows that the whole of
reality is like an ever-flowing stream, and that nothing
is ever at rest for a moment. The substance of the
things we see is in constant change. Even as we look
at them, some of the matter of which they are composed
has already passed into something else, while fresh
matter has come into them from another source. This
theory is usually summed up, appropriately enough,
in the phrase “All things are flowing” (πάντα ῥεῖ),
though, as it happens, it cannot be proved that this is
a quotation from Herakleitos. Plato, however, expresses
the idea quite clearly. “Nothing ever is, everything is
becoming”; “All things are in motion like streams”;
“All things are passing, and nothing abides”; “Herakleitos
says somewhere that all things pass and naught
abides; and, comparing things to the current of a river,
he says that you cannot step twice into the same stream”
(cf. fr. <a href='#He.41'>41</a>)—these are the terms in which he describes
the system. And Aristotle says the same thing, “All
things are in motion,” “nothing steadfastly is.”<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c014'><sup>[375]</sup></a>
Herakleitos held, in fact, that any given thing, however
stable in appearance, was merely a section in the
stream, and that the matter composing it was never
the same in any two consecutive moments of time.
We shall see presently how he conceived this process
to operate; meanwhile we remark that the idea was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>not altogether novel, and that it is hardly the central
point in the system of Herakleitos. The Milesians
held a similar view. The flux of Herakleitos was at
most more unceasing and universal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Upward and Downward path.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec71'></a>71. Herakleitos appears to have worked out the
details of the perpetual flux with reference to the
theories of Anaximenes.<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c014'><sup>[376]</sup></a> It is unlikely, however, that
he explained the transformations of matter by means
of rarefaction and condensation.<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c014'><sup>[377]</sup></a> Theophrastos, it
appears, suggested that he did; but he allowed it was
by no means clear. The passage from Diogenes which
we are about to quote has faithfully preserved this
touch.<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c014'><sup>[378]</sup></a> In the fragments, at any rate, we find
nothing about rarefaction and condensation. The
expression used is “exchange” (fr. <a href='#He.22'>22</a>); and this is
certainly a very good name for what happens when
fire gives out smoke and takes in fuel instead.</p>

<p class='c002'>It has been pointed out that, in default of Hippolytos,
our best account of the Theophrastean doxography of
Herakleitos is the fuller of the two accounts given in
Laertios Diogenes. It is as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>His opinions on particular points are these:—</p>

<p class='c002'>He held that Fire was the element, and that all things
were an exchange for fire, produced by condensation and
rarefaction. But he explains nothing clearly. All things were
produced in opposition, and all things were in flux like a river.</p>

<p class='c002'>The all is finite and the world is one. It arises from
fire, and is consumed again by fire alternately through all
eternity in certain cycles. This happens according to fate.
That which leads to the becoming of the opposites is called
War and Strife; that which leads to the final conflagration is
Concord and Peace.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>He called change the upward and the downward path, and
held that the world comes into being in virtue of this. When
fire is condensed it becomes moist, and when compressed it
turns to water; water being congealed turns to earth, and
this he calls the downward path. And, again, the earth is in
turn liquefied, and from it water arises, and from that
everything else; for he refers almost everything to the
evaporation from the sea. This is the path upwards.
R. P. 36.</p>

<p class='c002'>He held, too, that exhalations arose both from the sea and
the land; some bright and pure, others dark. Fire was
nourished by the bright ones, and moisture by the others.</p>

<p class='c002'>He does not make it clear what is the nature of that which
surrounds the world. He held, however, that there were
bowls in it with the concave sides turned towards us, in which
the bright exhalations were collected and produced flames.
These were the heavenly bodies.</p>

<p class='c002'>The flame of the sun was the brightest and warmest; for
the other heavenly bodies were more distant from the earth;
and for that reason gave less light and heat. The moon, on
the other hand, was nearer the earth; but it moved through
an impure region. The sun moved in a bright and unmixed
region, and at the same time was at just the right distance
from us. That is why it gives more heat and light. The
eclipses of the sun and moon were due to the turning of the
bowls upwards, while the monthly phases of the moon were
produced by a gradual turning of its bowl.</p>

<p class='c002'>Day and night, months and seasons and years, rains and
winds, and things like these, were due to the different
exhalations. The bright exhalation, when ignited in the
circle of the sun, produced day, and the preponderance of the
opposite exhalations produced night. The increase of warmth
proceeding from the bright exhalation produced summer, and
the preponderance of moisture from the dark exhalation
produced winter. He assigns the causes of other things in
conformity with this.</p>

<p class='c002'>As to the earth, he makes no clear statement about its
nature, any more than he does about that of the bowls.</p>

<p class='c002'>These, then, were his opinions. R. P. 39 b.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>It is obvious that, if we can trust this passage, it is
of the greatest possible value; and that, upon the whole,
we can trust it is shown by the fact that it follows the
exact order of topics to which all the doxographies
derived from the great work of Theophrastos adhere.
First we have the primary substance, then the world,
then the heavenly bodies, and lastly, meteorological
phenomena. We conclude, then, that it may be accepted
with the exceptions, firstly, of the probably erroneous
conjecture of Theophrastos as to rarefaction and
condensation mentioned above; and secondly, of some
pieces of Stoical interpretation which come from the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vetusta Placita</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c002'>Let us look at the details of the theory. The pure
fire, we are told, is to be found chiefly in the sun.
This, like the other heavenly bodies, is a trough or
bowl, or perhaps a sort of boat, with the concave side
turned towards us, in which the bright exhalations from
the sea collect and burn. How does the fire of the sun
pass into other forms? If we look at the fragments
which deal with the downward path, we find that the
first transformation that it undergoes is into sea, and
we are further told that half of the sea is earth and
half of it πρηστήρ (fr. <a href='#He.21'>21</a>). The full meaning of this
we shall see presently, but we must settle at once
what πρηστήρ is. Many theories have been advanced
upon the subject; but, so far as I know, no one<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c014'><sup>[379]</sup></a> has
yet proposed to take the word in the sense which it
always bears elsewhere, that, namely, of hurricane
accompanied by a fiery waterspout.<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c014'><sup>[380]</sup></a> Yet surely this is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>just what is wanted. It is amply attested that
Herakleitos explained the rise of the sea to fire by
means of the bright evaporations; and we want a
similar meteorological explanation of the passing of
the fire back into sea. We want, in fact, something
which will stand equally for the smoke produced by the
burning of the sun and for the immediate stage between
fire and water. What could serve the turn better than
a fiery waterspout? It sufficiently resembles smoke to
be accounted for as the product of the sun’s combustion,
and it certainly comes down in the form of water.
And this interpretation becomes practically certain
when taken in connexion with the report of Aetios as
to the Herakleitean theory of πρηστῆρες. They were
due, we are told, “to the kindling and extinction of
clouds.”<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c014'><sup>[381]</sup></a> In other words, the bright vapour, after
kindling in the bowl of the sun and going out again,
reappears as the dark fiery storm-cloud, and so passes
once more into sea. At the next stage we find water
continually passing into earth. We are already
familiar with this idea (<a href='#sec10'>§ 10</a>), and no more need be said
about it. Turning to the “upward path,” we find that
the earth is liquefied in the same proportion as the sea
becomes earth, so that the sea is still “measured by
the same tale” (fr. <a href='#He.23'>23</a>). Half of it is earth and half of
it is πρηστήρ (fr. <a href='#He.21'>21</a>). This must mean that, at any
given moment, half of the sea is taking the downward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>path, and has just been fiery storm-cloud, while half of
it is going up, and has just been earth. In proportion
as the sea is increased by rain, water passes into earth;
in proportion as the sea is diminished by evaporation,
it is fed by the earth. Lastly, the ignition of the
bright vapour from the sea in the bowl of the sun completes
the circle of the “upward and downward path.”</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Measure for measure.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec72'></a>72. The question now arises, How is it that, in spite
of this constant flux, things appear relatively stable?
The answer of Herakleitos was that it is owing to the
observance of the “measures,” in virtue of which the
aggregate bulk of each form of matter in the long run
remains the same, though its substance is constantly
changing. Certain “measures” of the “ever-living fire”
are always being kindled, while like “measures” are
always going out (fr. <a href='#He.20'>20</a>); and these measures the sun
will not exceed. All things are “exchanged” for fire
and fire for all things (fr. <a href='#He.22'>22</a>), and this implies that for
everything it takes, fire will give as much. “The sun
will not exceed his measures” (fr. <a href='#He.29'>29</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>And yet the “measures” are not to be regarded as
absolutely fixed. We gather from the passage of
Diogenes quoted above that Theophrastos spoke of an
alternate preponderance of the bright and dark
exhalations, and Aristotle speaks of Herakleitos as
explaining all things by evaporation.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c014'><sup>[382]</sup></a> In particular,
the alternation of day and night, summer and winter,
were accounted for in this way. Now, in a passage of
the pseudo-Hippokratean treatise Περὶ διαίτης which is
almost certainly of Herakleitean origin,<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c014'><sup>[383]</sup></a> we read of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“advance of fire and water” in connexion with day and
night and the courses of the sun and moon.<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c014'><sup>[384]</sup></a> In fr. <a href='#He.26'>26</a>,
again, we read of fire “advancing,” and all these things
seem to be intimately connected. We must therefore
try to see whether there is anything in the remaining
fragments that bears upon the subject.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Man</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec73'></a>73. In studying this alternate advance of fire
and water, it will be convenient to start with the
microcosm. We have more definite information about
the two exhalations in man than about the analogous
processes in the world at large, and it would seem that
Herakleitos himself explained the world by man rather
than man by the world. In a well-known passage,
Aristotle implies that soul is identical with the dry
exhalation,<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c014'><sup>[385]</sup></a> and this is fully confirmed by the fragments.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Man is made up of three things, fire, water, and earth.
But, just as in the macrocosm fire is identified with
the one wisdom, so in the microcosm the fire alone is
conscious. When it has left the body, the remainder,
the mere earth and water, is altogether worthless (fr. <a href='#He.85'>85</a>).
Of course, the fire which animates man is subject to
the “upward and downward path,” just as much as the
fire of the world. The Περὶ διαίτης has preserved the
obviously Herakleitean sentence: “All things are passing,
both human and divine, upwards and downwards
by exchanges.”<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c014'><sup>[386]</sup></a> We are just as much in perpetual
flux as anything else in the world. We are and are
not the same for two consecutive instants (fr. <a href='#He.81'>81</a>).
The fire in us is perpetually becoming water, and the
water earth; but, as the opposite process goes on
simultaneously, we appear to remain the same.<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c014'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>(<i>a</i>) Sleeping and waking.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec74'></a>74. This, however, is not all. Man is subject to a
certain oscillation in his “measures” of fire and water,
and this gives rise to the alternations of sleeping and
waking, life and death. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>locus classicus</i></span> on this
subject is a passage of Sextus Empiricus, which
reproduces the account of the Herakleitean psychology
given by Ainesidemos (Skeptic, <i>c.</i> 80-50 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c014'><sup>[388]</sup></a> It
is as follows (R. P. 41):—</p>

<div><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span></div>
<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>The natural philosopher is of opinion that what surrounds
us<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c014'><sup>[389]</sup></a> is rational and endowed with consciousness. According
to Herakleitos, when we draw in this divine reason by means
of respiration, we become rational. In sleep we forget, but
at our waking we become conscious once more. For in sleep,
when the openings of the senses close, the mind which is in
us is cut off from contact with that which surrounds us, and
only our connexion with it by means of respiration is preserved
as a sort of root (from which the rest may spring again);
and, when it is thus separated, it loses the power of memory
that it had before. When we awake again, however, it looks
out through the openings of the senses, as if through windows,
and coming together with the surrounding mind, it assumes
the power of reason. Just, then, as embers, when they are
brought near the the fire, change and become red-hot, and go
out when they are taken away from it again, so does the
portion of the surrounding mind which sojourns in our body
become irrational when it is cut off, and so does it become of
like nature to the whole when contact is established through
the greatest number of openings.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>In this passage there is obviously a very large
admixture of later phraseology and of later ideas. In
particular, the identification of “that which surrounds
us” with the air cannot be Herakleitean; for Herakleitos
can have known nothing of air, which in his day
was regarded as a form of water (<a href='#sec27'>§ 27</a>). The
reference to the pores or openings of the senses is
probably foreign to him also; for the theory of pores
is due to Alkmaion (<a href='#sec96'>§ 96</a>). Lastly, the distinction
between mind and body is far too sharply drawn. On
the other hand, the important rôle assigned to
respiration may very well be Herakleitean; for we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>have met with it already in Anaximenes. And we can
hardly doubt that the striking simile of the embers
which glow when they are brought near the fire is
genuine (cf. fr. <a href='#He.77'>77</a>). The true Herakleitean doctrine
doubtless was, that sleep was produced by the
encroachment of moist, dark exhalations from the
water in the body, which cause the fire to burn low.
In sleep, we lose contact with the fire in the world
which is common to all, and retire to a world of our
own (fr. <a href='#He.95'>95</a>). In a soul where the fire and water
are evenly balanced, the equilibrium is restored in the
morning by an equal advance of the bright exhalation.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(<i>b</i>) Life and death.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec75'></a>75. But in no soul are the fire and water thus
evenly balanced for long. One or the other acquires
predominance, and the result in either case is death.
Let us take each of these cases in turn. It is death, we
know, to souls to become water (fr. <a href='#He.68'>68</a>); but that is
just what happens to souls which seek after pleasure.
For pleasure is a moistening of the soul (fr. <a href='#He.72'>72</a>), as
may be seen in the case of the drunken man, who, in
pursuit of it, has moistened his soul to such an extent
that he does not know where he is going (fr. <a href='#He.73'>73</a>).
Even in gentle relaxation over our cups, it is more
difficult to hide folly than at other times (fr. <a href='#He.108'>108</a>).
That is why it is so necessary for us to quench
wantonness (fr. <a href='#He.103'>103</a>); for whatever our heart’s desire
insists on it purchases at the price of life, that is, of the
fire within us (fr. <a href='#He.105'>105</a>). Take now the other case.
The dry soul, that which has least moisture, is the best
(fr. <a href='#He.74'>74</a>); but the preponderance of fire causes death as
much as that of water. It is a very different death,
however, and wins “greater portions” for those who
die it (fr. <a href='#He.101'>101</a>). Apparently those who fall in battle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>share their lot (fr. <a href='#He.102'>102</a>). We have no fragment which
tells us directly what it is, but the class of utterances we
are about to look at next leaves little doubt on the
subject. Those who die the fiery and not the watery
death, become, in fact, gods, though in a different sense
from that in which the one Wisdom is god. It is
probable that the corrupt fragment <a href='#He.123'>123</a> refers to this
unexpected fate (fr. <a href='#He.122'>122</a>) that awaits men when they die.</p>

<p class='c002'>Further, just as summer and winter are one, and
necessarily reproduce one another by their “opposite
tension,” so do life and death. They, too, are one, we
are told; and so are youth and age (fr. <a href='#He.78'>78</a>). It follows
that the soul will be now living and now dead; that it
will only turn to fire or water, as the case may be, to
recommence once more its unceasing upward and
downward path. The soul that has died from excess
of moisture sinks down to earth; but from the earth
comes water, and from water is once more exhaled a
soul (fr. <a href='#He.68'>68</a>). So, too, we are told (fr. 67) that gods
and men are really one. They live each others’ life,
and die each others’ death. Those mortals that die
the fiery death become immortal,<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c014'><sup>[390]</sup></a> they become the
guardians of the quick and the dead (fr. <a href='#He.123'>123</a>);<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c014'><sup>[391]</sup></a> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>those immortals become mortal in their turn. Everything
is really the death of something else (fr. <a href='#He.64'>64</a>).
The living and the dead are always changing places
(fr. 78), like the pieces on a child’s draught-board
(fr. 79), and this applies not only to the souls that
have become water, but to those that have become fire
and are now guardian spirits. The real weariness is
continuance in the same state (fr. <a href='#He.82'>82</a>), and the real rest
is change (fr. <a href='#He.83'>83</a>). Rest in any other sense is
tantamount to dissolution (fr. <a href='#He.84'>84</a>).<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c014'><sup>[392]</sup></a> So they too are
born once more. Herakleitos estimated the duration
of the cycle which preserves the balance of life and
death as thirty years, the shortest time in which a man
may become a grandfather (frs. 87-89).<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c014'><sup>[393]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The day and the year.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec76'></a>76. Let us turn now to the world. Diogenes tells
us that fire was kept up by the bright vapours from land
and sea, and moisture by the dark.<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c014'><sup>[394]</sup></a> What are these
“dark” vapours which increase the moist element? If
we remember the “Air” of Anaximenes, we shall be
inclined to regard them as darkness itself. We know
that the idea of darkness as privation of light is not
natural to the unsophisticated mind. We sometimes
hear even now of darkness “thick enough to cut with
a knife.” I suppose, then, that Herakleitos believed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>night and winter to be produced by the rise of darkness
from earth and sea—he saw, of course, that the
valleys were dark before the hill-tops,—and that this
darkness, being moist, so increased the watery element
as to put out the sun’s light. This, however, destroys
the power of darkness itself. It can no longer rise
upwards unless the sun gives it motion, and so it
becomes possible for a fresh sun (fr. <a href='#He.32'>32</a>) to be kindled,
and to nourish itself at the expense of the moist
element for a time. But it can only be for a time.
The sun, by burning up the bright vapour, deprives
himself of nourishment, and the dark vapour once more
gets the upper hand. It is in this sense that “day and
night are one” (fr. <a href='#He.35'>35</a>). Each implies the other, and
they are therefore to be regarded as merely two sides
of the one, in which alone their true ground of explanation
is to be found (fr. <a href='#He.36'>36</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>Summer and winter were easily to be explained in
the same way. We know that the “turnings” of the
sun were a subject of interest in those days, and it was
natural for Herakleitos to see in its retreat further to
the south the gradual advance of the moist element,
caused by the heat of the sun itself. This, however,
diminishes the power of the sun to cause evaporation,
and so it must return to the north once more that it
may supply itself with nourishment. Such was, at any
rate, the Stoic doctrine on the subject,<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c014'><sup>[395]</sup></a> and that it
comes from Herakleitos seems to be proved by its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>occurrence in the Περὶ διαίτης. It seems impossible to
refer the following sentence to any other source:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>And in turn each (fire and water) prevails and is prevailed
over to the greatest and least degree that is possible. For
neither can prevail altogether for the following reasons. If fire
advances towards the utmost limit of the water, its nourishment
fails it. It retires, then, to a place where it can get
nourishment. And if water advances towards the utmost limit
of the fire, movement fails it. At that point, then, it stands
still; and, when it has come to a stand, it has no longer power
to resist, but is consumed as nourishment for the fire that falls
upon it. For these reasons neither can prevail altogether.
But if at any time either should be in any way overcome,
then none of the things that exist would be as they are now.
So long as things are as they are, fire and water will always be
too, and neither will ever fail.<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c014'><sup>[396]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Great Year.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec77'></a>77. Herakleitos spoke also of a longer period, which
is identified with the “Great Year,” and is variously
described as lasting 18,000 and 10,800 years.<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c014'><sup>[397]</sup></a> We
have no definite statement, however, of what process
Herakleitos supposed to take place in the Great Year.
We have seen that the period of 36,000 years was, in
all probability, Babylonian, and was that of the revolution
which produces the precession of the equinoxes.<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c014'><sup>[398]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Now 18,000 years is just half that period, a fact which
may be connected with Herakleitos’s way of dividing
all cycles into an “upward and downward path” It is
not at all likely, however, that Herakleitos, who held
with Xenophanes that the sun was “new every day,”
would trouble himself about the precession of the
equinoxes, and we seem forced to assume that he
gave some new application to the traditional period.
The Stoics, or some of them, held that the Great Year
was the period between one world-conflagration and
the next. They were careful, however, to make it a
good deal longer than Herakleitos did, and, in any
case, we are not entitled without more ado to credit
him with the theory of a general conflagration.<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c014'><sup>[399]</sup></a> We
must try first, if possible, to interpret the Great Year
on the analogy of the shorter periods discussed
already.</p>

<p class='c002'>Now we have seen that a generation is the shortest
time in which a man can become a grandfather, it is
the period of the upward or downward path of the soul,
and the most natural interpretation of the longer period
would surely be that it represents the time taken by a
“measure” of the fire in the world to travel on the
downward path to earth or return to fire once more by
the upward path. Plato certainly implies that such a
parallelism between the periods of man and the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>was recognised,<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c014'><sup>[400]</sup></a> and this receives a curious confirmation
from a passage in Aristotle, which is usually supposed
to refer to the doctrine of a periodic conflagration. He
is discussing the question whether the “heavens,” that
is to say, what he calls the “first heaven,” is eternal or
not, and he naturally enough, from his own point of
view, identifies this with the Fire of Herakleitos. He
quotes him along with Empedokles as holding that the
“heavens” are alternately as they are now and in some
other state, one of passing away; and he goes on to
point out that this is not really to say they pass away,
any more than it would be to say that a man ceases to
be, if we said that he turned from boy to man and then
from man to boy again.<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c014'><sup>[401]</sup></a> It is surely clear that this is
a reference to the parallel between the generation and
the Great Year, and, if so, the ordinary interpretation of
the passage must be wrong. It is true that it is not
quite consistent with the theory to suppose that a
“measure” of Fire could preserve its identity throughout
the whole of its upward and downward path; but
it is exactly the same inconsistency that we have felt
bound to recognise with regard to the continuance
of individual souls, a fact which is really in favour
of our interpretation. It should be added that, while
18,000 is half 36,000, 10,800 is 360 × 30, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>would make each generation a day in the Great
Year.<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c014'><sup>[402]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Did Herakleitos teach a general conflagration?</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec78'></a>78. Most modern writers, however, ascribe to
Herakleitos the doctrine of a periodical conflagration or
ἐκπύρωσις, to use the Stoic term.<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c014'><sup>[403]</sup></a> That this is inconsistent
with the theory, as we have interpreted it, is
obvious, and is indeed admitted by Zeller. To his
paraphrase of the statement of Plato quoted above
(p. 159) he adds the words: “Herakleitos did not intend
to retract this principle in the doctrine of a periodic
change in the constitution of the world; if the two
doctrines are not compatible, it is a contradiction which
he has not observed.” Now, it is in itself quite likely
that there were contradictions in the discourse of
Herakleitos, but it is very unlikely that there was this
particular one. In the first place, it is a contradiction
of the central idea of his system, the thought that possessed
his whole mind (<a href='#sec67'>§ 67</a>), and we can only admit
the possibility of that, if the evidence for it should
prove irresistible. In the second place, such an interpretation
destroys the whole point of Plato’s contrast
between Herakleitos and Empedokles (<a href='#sec68'>§ 68</a>), which is
just that, while Herakleitos said the One was always
many, and the Many always one, Empedokles said the
All was many and one by turns. Zeller’s interpretation
obliges us, then, to suppose that Herakleitos flatly contradicted
his own discovery without noticing it, and
that Plato, in discussing this very discovery, was also
blind to the contradiction.<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c014'><sup>[404]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Nor is there anything in Aristotle to set against
Plato’s emphatic statement. We have seen that the
passage in which he speaks of him along with
Empedokles as holding that the heavens were
alternately in one condition and in another refers not
to the world in general, but to fire, which Aristotle
identified with the substance of his own “first heaven.”<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c014'><sup>[405]</sup></a>
It is also quite consistent with our interpretation when
he says that all things at one time or another become
fire. This does not necessarily mean that they all
become fire at the same time, but is merely a statement
of the undoubted Herakleitean doctrine of the upward
and downward path.<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c014'><sup>[406]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The only clear statements to the effect that
Herakleitos taught the doctrine of a general conflagration
are posterior to the rise of Stoicism. It is
unnecessary to enumerate them, as there is no doubt
about their meaning. The Christian apologists too
were interested in the idea of a final conflagration, and
reproduce the Stoic view. The curious thing, however,
is that there was a difference of opinion on the subject
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>even among the Stoics. In one place, Marcus Aurelius
says: “So that all these things are taken up into
the Reason of the universe, whether by a periodical
conflagration or a renovation effected by external
exchanges.”<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c014'><sup>[407]</sup></a> Indeed, there were some who said there
was no general conflagration at all in Herakleitos. “I
hear all that,” Plutarch makes one of his personages
say, “from many people, and I see the Stoic conflagration
spreading over the poems of Hesiod, just as it
does over the writings of Herakleitos and the verses of
Orpheus.”<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c014'><sup>[408]</sup></a> We see from this that the question was
debated, and we should therefore expect that any statement
of Herakleitos which could settle it would be
quoted over and over again. It is highly significant
that not a single quotation of the kind can be produced.</p>

<p class='c002'>On the contrary, the absence of anything to show
that Herakleitos spoke of a general conflagration only
becomes more patent when we turn to the few fragments
which are supposed to prove it. The favourite is fr. <a href='#He.24'>24</a>,
where we are told that Herakleitos said Fire was Want
and Surfeit. That is just in his manner, and it has a
perfectly intelligible meaning on our interpretation,
which is further confirmed by fr. <a href='#He.36'>36</a>. On the other
hand, it seems distinctly artificial to understand the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Surfeit as referring to the fact that fire has burnt everything
else up, and still more so to interpret Want as
meaning that fire, or most of it, has turned into a
world. The next is fr. <a href='#He.26'>26</a>, where we read that fire in
its advance will judge and convict all things. There
is nothing in this, however, to suggest that fire will
judge all things at once rather than in turn, and,
indeed, the phraseology reminds us of the advance of
fire and water which we have seen reason for attributing
to Herakleitos, but which is expressly said to be
limited to a certain maximum.<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c014'><sup>[409]</sup></a> These appear to be
the only passages which the Stoics and the Christian
apologists could discover, and, whether our interpretation
of them is right or wrong, it is surely obvious that
they cannot bear the weight of their conclusion, and
that there was certainly nothing more definite to be
found.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is much easier to find fragments which are on
the face of them inconsistent with a general conflagration.
The “measures” of fr. <a href='#He.20'>20</a> and fr. <a href='#He.29'>29</a> must be
the same thing, and they must surely be interpreted
in the light of fr. <a href='#He.23'>23</a>. If this be so, fr. <a href='#He.20'>20</a>, and more
especially fr. <a href='#He.29'>29</a>, directly contradict the idea of a
general conflagration. “The sun will not overstep his
measures.”<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c014'><sup>[410]</sup></a> Secondly, the metaphor of “exchange,”
which is applied to the transformations of fire in fr. <a href='#He.22'>22</a>,
points in the same direction. When gold is given in
exchange for wares and wares for gold, the sum or
“measure” of each remains constant, though they
change owners. All the wares and gold do not come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>into the same hands. In the same way, when anything
becomes fire, something of equal amount must cease to
be fire, if the “exchange” is to be a just one; and
that it will be just, we are assured by the watchfulness
of the Erinyes (fr. <a href='#He.29'>29</a>), who see to it that the sun does
not take more than he gives. Of course there is, as we
have seen, a certain variation; but this is strictly confined
within limits, and is compensated in the long run
by a variation in the other direction. Thirdly, fr. <a href='#He.43'>43</a>,
in which Herakleitos blames Homer for desiring the
cessation of strife, is very conclusive. The cessation of
strife would mean that all things should take the
upward or downward path at the same time, and cease
to “run in opposite directions.” If they all took the
upward path, we should have a general conflagration.
Now, if Herakleitos had himself held that this was the
appointment of fate, would he have been likely to
upbraid Homer for desiring so necessary a consummation?<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c014'><sup>[411]</sup></a>
Fourthly, we note that in fr. <a href='#He.20'>20</a> it is <em>this</em> world,<a id='r412' /><a href='#f412' class='c014'><sup>[412]</sup></a>
and not merely the “ever-living fire,” which is said to
be eternal; and it appears also that its eternity
depends upon the fact that it is always kindling and
always going out in the same “measures,” or that
an encroachment in one direction is compensated by
a subsequent encroachment in the other. Lastly,
Lassalle’s argument from the concluding sentence of
the passage from the Περὶ διαίτης, quoted above, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>really untouched by Zeller’s objection, that it cannot
be Herakleitean because it implies that all things are
fire and water. It does not imply this, but only that
<em>man</em>, like the heavenly bodies, oscillates between fire
and water; and that is just what Herakleitos taught.
It does not appear either that the measures of earth
varied at all. Now, in this passage we read that
neither fire nor water can prevail completely, and a
very good reason is given for this, a reason too which
is in striking agreement with the other views of
Herakleitos.<a id='r413' /><a href='#f413' class='c014'><sup>[413]</sup></a> And, indeed, it is not easy to see how,
in accordance with these views, the world could ever
recover from a general conflagration if such a thing
were to take place. The whole process depends, so
far as we can see, on the fact that Surfeit is also Want,
or, in other words, that an advance of fire increases the
moist exhalation, while an advance of water deprives
the fire of the power to cause evaporation. The conflagration,
though it lasted but for a moment,<a id='r414' /><a href='#f414' class='c014'><sup>[414]</sup></a> would
destroy the opposite tension on which the rise of a
new world depends, and then motion would become
impossible.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strife and “harmony.”</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span><a id='sec79'></a>79. We are now in a position to understand more
clearly the law of strife or opposition which manifests
itself in the “upward and downward path.” At any
given moment, each of the three forms of matter, Fire,
Water, and Earth, is made up of two equal portions,—subject,
of course, to the oscillation described above,—one
of which is taking the upward and the other the
downward path. Now, it is just the fact that the
two halves of everything are being “drawn in opposite
directions,” this “opposite tension,” that “keeps things
together,” and maintains them in an equilibrium which
can only be disturbed temporarily and within certain
limits. It thus forms the “hidden attunement” of the
universe (fr. <a href='#He.47'>47</a>), though, in another aspect of it, it is
Strife. Bernays has pointed out that the word ἁρμονία
meant originally “structure,” and the illustration of the
bow and the lyre shows that this idea was present.
On the other hand, that taken from the concord of
high and low notes shows that the musical sense of the
word, namely, an octave, was not wholly absent. As
to the “bow and the lyre” (fr. <a href='#He.45'>45</a>), I think that Professor
Campbell has best brought out the point of the simile.
“As the arrow leaves the string,” he says, “the hands
are pulling opposite ways to each other, and to the
different parts of the bow (cf. Plato, <cite>Rep.</cite> 4. 439); and
the sweet note of the lyre is due to a similar tension
and retention. The secret of the universe is the same.”<a id='r415' /><a href='#f415' class='c014'><sup>[415]</sup></a>
War, then, is the father and king of all things, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>world as in human society (fr. <a href='#He.44'>44</a>); and Homer’s wish
that strife might cease was really a prayer for the
destruction of the world (fr. <a href='#He.43'>43</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>We know from Philo that Herakleitos supported
his theory of the attainment of harmony through strife
by a multitude of examples; and, as it happens, some
of these can be recovered. There is a remarkable
agreement between a passage of this kind in the pseudo-Aristotelian
treatise, entitled <cite>The Kosmos</cite>, and the
Hippokratean work to which we have already referred.
That the authors of both drew from the same source,
namely, Herakleitos, is probable in itself, and is made
practically certain by the fact that this agreement
extends in part to the <cite>Letters of Herakleitos</cite>, which,
though spurious, were certainly composed by some one
who had access to the original work. The argument
was that men themselves act just in the same way as
Nature, and it is therefore surprising that they do not
recognise the laws by which she works. The painter
produces his harmonious effects by the contrast of
colours, the musician by that of high and low notes.
“If one were to make all things alike, there would
be no delight in them.” There are many similar
examples in the Hippokratean tract, some of which
must certainly come from Herakleitos; but it is not
easy to separate them from the later additions.<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c014'><sup>[416]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Correlation of opposites.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span><a id='sec80'></a>80. There are a number of Herakleitean fragments
which form a class by themselves, and are among the
most striking of all the utterances that have come
down to us. Their common characteristic is, that
they assert in the most downright way the identity of
various things which are usually regarded as opposites.
The clue to their meaning is to be found in the account
already given of the assertion that day and night are
one. We have seen that Herakleitos meant to say,
not that day was night or that night was day, but
that they were two sides of the same process, namely,
the oscillation of the “measures” of fire and water,
and that neither would be possible without the other.
Any explanation that can be given of night will also be
an explanation of day, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>; for it will be
an account of that which is common to both, and
manifests itself now as one and now as the other.
Moreover, it is just because it has manifested itself in
the one form that it must next appear in the other;
for this is required by the law of compensation or
Justice.</p>

<p class='c002'>This is only a particular application of the universal
principle that the primary fire is one even in its
division. It itself is, even in its unity, both surfeit
and want, war and peace (fr. <a href='#He.36'>36</a>). In other words, the
“satiety” which makes fire pass into other forms, which
makes it seek “rest in change” (frs. <a href='#He.82'>82</a>, <a href='#He.83'>83</a>), and “hide
itself” (fr. <a href='#He.10'>10</a>) in the “hidden attunement” of opposition,
is only one side of the process. The other is the
“want” which leads it to consume the bright vapour as
fuel. The upward path is nothing without the downward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>(fr. <a href='#He.69'>69</a>). If either were to cease, the other would
cease too, and the world would disappear; for it takes
both to make an apparently stable reality.</p>

<p class='c002'>All other utterances of the kind are to be explained
in the same way. If there were no cold, there would
be no heat; for a thing can only grow warm if, and in
so far as, it is already cold. And the same thing applies
to the opposition of wet and dry (fr. <a href='#He.39'>39</a>). These, it
will be observed, are just the two primary oppositions
of Anaximander, and Herakleitos is showing that the
war between them is really peace, for it is the common
element in them (fr. <a href='#He.62'>62</a>) which appears as strife, and
that very strife is justice, and not, as Anaximander had
taught, an injustice which they commit one against the
other, and which must be expiated by a reabsorption of
both in their common ground.<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c014'><sup>[417]</sup></a> The strife itself is the
common ground (fr. <a href='#He.62'>62</a>), and is eternal.</p>

<p class='c002'>The most startling of these sayings is that which
affirms that good and evil are the same (fr. <a href='#He.57'>57</a>). This
does not mean in the least, however, that good is evil
or that evil is good, but simply that they are the two
inseparable halves of one and the same thing. A
thing can become good only in so far as it is already
evil, and evil only in so far as it is already good, and
everything depends on the contrast. The illustration
given in fr. <a href='#He.58'>58</a> shows this clearly. Torture, one would
say, was an evil, and yet it is made a good by the
presence of another evil, namely, disease; as is shown
by the fact that surgeons expect a fee for inflicting
it upon their patients. Justice, on the other hand,
which is a good, would be altogether unknown were
it not for the existence of injustice, which is an evil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>(fr. <a href='#He.60'>60</a>). And that is why it is not good for men to
get everything they wish (fr. <a href='#He.104'>104</a>). Just as the cessation
of strife in the world would mean its destruction,
so the disappearance of hunger, disease, and weariness
would mean the disappearance of satisfaction, health,
and rest.</p>

<p class='c002'>This leads to a theory of relativity which prepares
the way for the doctrine of Protagoras, that “Man is
the measure of all things.”<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c014'><sup>[418]</sup></a> Sea-water is good for fish
and bad for men (fr. <a href='#He.52'>52</a>), and so with many other
things. At the same time, Herakleitos is not a believer
in absolute relativity. The process of the world is not
merely a circle, but an “upward and downward path.”
At the upper end, where the two paths meet, we have
the pure fire, in which, as there is no separation, there
is no relativity. We are told expressly that, while
to man some things are evil and some things are good,
all things are good to God (fr. <a href='#He.61'>61</a>). Now by God there
is no doubt that Herakleitos meant Fire. He also
calls it the “one wise,” and perhaps said that it
“knows all things.” There can hardly be any question
that what he meant to say was that in it the opposition
and relativity which are universal in the world
disappear. It is doubtless to this that frs. <a href='#He.96'>96</a>, <a href='#He.97'>97</a>, and
<a href='#He.98'>98</a> refer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Wise.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec81'></a>81. Herakleitos speaks of “wisdom” or the “wise”
in two senses. We have seen already that he said
wisdom was “something apart from everything else”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>(fr. <a href='#He.18'>18</a>), meaning by it the perception of the unity of the
many; and he also applies the term to that unity itself
regarded as the “thought that directs the course of all
things.” This is synonymous with the pure fire which
is not differentiated into two parts, one taking the
upward and the other the downward path. That alone
has wisdom; the partial things we see have not. We
ourselves are only wise in so far as we are fiery (fr. <a href='#He.74'>74</a>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec82'></a>82. With certain reservations, Herakleitos was prepared
to call the one Wisdom by the name of Zeus.
Such, at least, appears to be the meaning of fr. <a href='#He.65'>65</a>.
What these reservations were, it is easy to guess. It is
not, of course, to be pictured in the form of a man. In
saying this, Herakleitos would only have been repeating
what had already been laid down by Anaximander and
Xenophanes. He agrees further with Xenophanes in
holding that this “god,” if it is to be called so, is one;
but his polemic against popular religion was directed
rather against the rites and ceremonies themselves
than their mere mythological outgrowth. He gives a
list (fr. <a href='#He.124'>124</a>) of some of the most characteristic
religious figures of his time, and the context in
which the fragment is quoted shows that he in some
way threatened them with the wrath to come. He
comments upon the absurdity of praying to images
(fr. <a href='#He.126'>126</a>), and the strange idea that blood-guiltiness can
be washed out by the shedding of blood (fr. <a href='#He.130'>130</a>). He
seems also to have said that it was absurd to celebrate
the worship of Dionysos by cheerful and licentious
ceremonies, while Hades was propitiated by gloomy rites
(fr. <a href='#He.127'>127</a>). According to the mystic doctrine itself, the
two were really one; and the one Wisdom ought to be
worshipped in its integrity.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>The few fragments which deal with theology and
religion hardly suggest to us that Herakleitos was in
sympathy with the religious revival of the time, and yet
we have been asked to consider his system “in the
light of the idea of the mysteries.”<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c014'><sup>[419]</sup></a> Our attention
is called to the fact that he was “king” of Ephesos,
that is, priest of the branch of the Eleusinian mysteries
established in that city, which was also connected in
some way with the worship of Artemis or the Great
Mother.<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c014'><sup>[420]</sup></a> These statements may be true; but, even if
they are, what follows? We ought surely to have
learnt from Lobeck by this time that there was no
“idea” in the mysteries at all; and on this point
the results of recent anthropological research have
abundantly confirmed those of philological and
historical inquiry.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Ethics of Herakleitos.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec83'></a>83. The moral teaching of Herakleitos has sometimes
been regarded as an anticipation of the “common-sense”
theory of Ethics.<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c014'><sup>[421]</sup></a> The “common” upon which
Herakleitos insists is, nevertheless, something very
different from common sense, for which, indeed, he
had the greatest possible contempt (fr. 111). It is,
in fact, his strongest objection to “the many,” that
they live each in his own world (fr. <a href='#He.95'>95</a>), as if they
had a private wisdom of their own (fr. <a href='#He.92'>92</a>); and public
opinion is therefore just the opposite of “the common.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Ethics of Herakleitos are to be regarded as
a corollary of his anthropological and cosmological
views. Their chief requirement is that we keep our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>souls dry, and thus assimilate them to the one Wisdom,
which is fire. That is what is really “common,” and
the greatest fault is to act like men asleep (fr. <a href='#He.94'>94</a>),
that is, by letting our souls grow moist, to cut ourselves
off from the fire in the world. We do not
know what were the consequences which Herakleitos
deduced from his rule that we must hold fast to
what is common, but it is easy to see what their
nature must have been. The wise man would not try
to secure good without its correlative evil. He would
not seek for rest without exertion, nor expect to enjoy
contentment without first suffering discontent. He
would not complain that he had to take the bad with
the good, but would consistently look at things as a
whole.</p>

<p class='c002'>Herakleitos prepared the way for the Stoic world-state
by comparing “the common” to the laws of a
city. And these are even more than a type of the
divine law: they are imperfect embodiments of it.
They cannot, however, exhaust it altogether; for in
all human affairs there is an element of relativity
(fr. <a href='#He.91a'>91</a>). “Man is a baby compared to God” (fr. <a href='#He.97'>97</a>).
Such as they are, however, the city must fight for
them as for its walls; and, if it has the good fortune
to possess a citizen with a dry soul, he is worth ten
thousand (fr. <a href='#He.113'>113</a>); for in him alone is “the common”
embodied.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#r330'>330</a>. In his edition, Diels has given up all attempt to arrange the fragments
according to subject, and this makes his text unsuitable for our purpose.
I think, too, that he overestimates the difficulty of an approximate arrangement,
and makes too much of the view that the style of Herakleitos was
“aphoristic.” That it was so, is an important and valuable remark; but
it does not follow that Herakleitos wrote like Nietzsche. For a Greek,
however prophetic in his tone, there must always be a distinction between
an aphoristic and an incoherent style. See the excellent remarks of Lortzing
in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Berl. Phil. Wochenschr.</cite></span> 1896, pp. 1 sqq.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f331'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r331'>331</a>. Both Bywater and Diels accept Bergk’s λόγου for δόγματος and Miller’s

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f332'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r332'>332</a>. The λόγος is simply the discourse of Herakleitos himself; though, as
he is a prophet, we may call it “the Word.” It can neither mean a
discourse addressed to Herakleitos nor yet “reason.” (Cf. Zeller, p. 630,
n. 1; Eng. trans. ii. p. 7, n. 2.) A difficulty has been raised about the words
ἐόντας αἰεί. How could Herakleitos say that his discourse had always
existed? The answer is that in Ionic ἐών means “true” when coupled
with words like λόγος. Cf. Herod. i. 30, τῷ ἐόντι χρησάμενος λέγει; and
even Aristoph. <cite>Frogs</cite>, 1052, οὐκ ὄντα λόγον. It is only by taking the words
in this way that we can understand Aristotle’s hesitation as to the proper
punctuation of the fragment (<cite>Rhet.</cite> Γ 5. 1407 b 15; R. P. 30 a). The Stoic
interpretation given by Marcus Aurelius, iv. 46 (R. P. 32 b), must be
rejected altogether. The word λόγος was never used like that till post-Aristotelian
times.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f333'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r333'>333</a>. I have departed from the punctuation of Bywater here, and supplied a
fresh object to the verb as suggested by Gomperz (<cite>Arch.</cite> i. 100).</p>

not ἐποίησεν, and ἐποιήσατο ἑαυτοῦ means “claimed as his own.” The words
ἐκλεξάμενος ταύτας τὰς συγγραφάς have been doubted since the time of
Schleiermacher, and Diels has now come to regard the whole fragment as
spurious. This is because it was used to prove that Pythagoras wrote
books (cf. Diels, <cite>Arch.</cite> iii. p. 451). As Mr. Bywater has pointed out,
however, the fragment itself makes no such statement; it only says that
he read books, which we may presume he did. I would further suggest
that the old-fashioned συγγραφάς is rather too good for a forger, and that
the omission of the very thing to be proved is remarkable. The last
suggestion of a book by Pythagoras disappears with the reading ἐποιήσατο
for ἐποίησεν. Of course a late writer who read of Pythagoras making
extracts from books would assume that he put them into a book of his own,
just as people did in his own days. For the rest, I understand ἱστορίη of
science, which is contrasted with the κακοτεχνίη which Pythagoras derived
from the συγγραφαί of men like Pherekydes of Syros.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f336'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r336'>336</a>. The word κόσμος must mean “world” here, not merely “order;” for
only the world could be identified with fire. This use of the word is
Pythagorean, and there is no reason to doubt that Herakleitos may have
known it.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#r339'>339</a>. The subject of fr. 23 is γῆ, as we see from Diog. ix. 9 (R. P. 36),
πάλιν τε αὖ τὴν γὴν χεῖσθαι; and Aet. i. 3, 11 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 284 a 1; b 5),
ἔπειτα ἀναχαλωμένην τὴν γῆν ὑπὸ τοῦ τυρὸς χύσει (Dübner: φύσει, libri)
ὕδωρ ἀποτελεῖσθαι. Herakleitos might quite well say γῆ θάλασσα διαχέεται,
and the context in Clement (<cite>Strom.</cite> v. p. 712) seems to imply this. The
phrase μετρέεται εἰς τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον can only mean that the proportion of
the measures remains constant. So practically Zeller (p. 690, n. 1), <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>zu

<div class='footnote' id='f342'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r342'>342</a>. In this fragment it is clear that οὖρος = τέρματα, and therefore means
“boundary,” not “hill.” As αἴθριος Ζεύς means the bright blue sky, I do
not think its οὖρος can be the South Pole, as Diels says. It is more likely
the horizon. I am inclined to take the fragment as a protest against the
Pythagorean theory of a southern hemisphere.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f343'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r343'>343</a>. We learn from Diog. ix. 10 (quoted below, p. <a href='#Page_164'>164</a>) that Herakleitos
explained why the sun was warmer and brighter than the moon, and this
is doubtless a fragment of that passage. I now think the words ἕνεκα τῶν

<p class='c002'><a href='#r347'>347</a>. I cannot think it likely that Herakleitos said both παλίντονος and
παλίντροπος ἁρμονίη, and I prefer Plutarch’s παλίντονος (R. P. 34 b) to the
παλίντροπος of Hippolytos. Diels thinks that the polemic of Parmenides
decides the question in favour of παλίντροπος; but see below, p. 184, <a href='#f415'><ins class='correction' title='n. 1'><i>n.</i> 415</ins></a>,

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f355'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r355'>355</a>. I think now with Diels that the words οὕτω βαθὺν λόγον ἔχει are
probably genuine. They present no difficulty if we remember that λόγος
means “measurement,” as in fr. <a href='#He.23'>23</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f356'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r356'>356</a>. This fragment is interesting because of the great antiquity of the
corruptions which it has suffered. According to Stephanus, who is followed
by Bywater and Diels, we should read: Αὔη ψυχὴ σοφωτάτη καὶ ἀρίστη,
ξηρή (or rather ξηρά—the Ionic form would only appear when the word got
into the text) being a mere gloss upon the somewhat unusual αὔη. When
once ξηρή got into the text, αὔη became αὐγή, and we get the sentence:
“the dry light is the wisest soul,” whence the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>siccum lumen</i></span> of Bacon.
Now this reading is certainly as old as Plutarch, who, in his Life of Romulus
(c. 28), takes αὐγή to mean lightning, as it sometimes does, and supposes
the idea to be that the wise soul bursts through the prison of the body like
dry lightning (whatever that may be) through a cloud. I do not think that
Clement’s making the same mistake proves anything at all (Zeller, p. 705,
n. 3; Eng. trans. i. p. 80, n. 2), except that he had read his Plutarch.
Lastly, it is worth noticing that, though Plutarch must have written αὐγή,
the MSS. vary between αὕτη and αὐτή. The next stage is the corruption
of the corrupt αὐγή into οὗ γῆ. This yields the sentiment that “where the
earth is dry, the soul is wisest,” and is as old as Philo (see Mr. Bywater’s
notes).</p>

these words must belong to Herakleitos, though Bywater omits them. On
the other hand, the words τοῦ λόγου δὲ ὄντος ξυνοῦ (so, not δ’ ἐόντος, the
best MSS.) seem clearly to belong to the Stoic interpreter whom Sextus is
following, and who was anxious to connect this fragment with fr. <a href='#He.2'>2</a> (ὀλίγα
προσδιελθὼν ἐπιφέρει) in order to get the doctrine of the κοινὸς λόγος. The

<div class='footnote' id='f359'>

Book iii. Good examples are Aet. i. 13, 2; 28, 1; iv. 3, 12,—where
distinctively Stoic doctrines are ascribed to Herakleitos. What the Stoics
were capable of, we see from Kleanthes, fr. 55, Pearson. He proposed to
read Ζεῦ ἀναδωδωναῖε in <cite>Il.</cite> xvi. 233, ὡς τὸν ἐκ τῆς γῆς ἀναθυμιώμενον

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f373'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r373'>373</a>. The source of his error was Hegel’s remarkable statement that there
was no proposition of Herakleitos that he had not taken up into his own
logic (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gesch. d. Phil.</cite></span> i. 328). The example which he cites is the statement
that Being does not exist any more than not-Being, for which he
refers to Arist. <cite>Met.</cite> Α, 4. This, however, is not there ascribed to Herakleitos
at all, but to Leukippos or Demokritos, with whom it meant that space was
as real as matter (<a href='#sec175'>§ 175</a>). Aristotle does, indeed, tell us in the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>
that “some” think Herakleitos says that the same thing can be and not
be; but he adds that it does not follow that a man thinks what he says
(<cite>Met.</cite> Γ 3. 1005 b 24). I take this to mean that, though Herakleitos
did make this assertion in words, he did not mean by it what the same
assertion would naturally have meant at a later date. Herakleitos was
speaking only of nature; the logical meaning of the words never occurred
to him. This is confirmed by Κ, 5. 1062 a 31, where we are told that by
being questioned in a certain manner Herakleitos could be made to admit
the principle of contradiction; as it was, he did not understand what he
said. In other words, he was unconscious of its logical bearing.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle was aware, then, that the theories of Herakleitos were not
to be understood in a logical sense. On the other hand, this does not
prevent him from saying that according to the view of Herakleitos, everything
would be true (<cite>Met.</cite> Δ, 7. 1012 a 24). If we remember his constant
attitude to earlier thinkers, this will not lead us to suspect either his good
faith or his intelligence. (See Appendix, <a href='#app1.2'>§ 2</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f374'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r374'>374</a>. That the Fire of Herakleitos was something on the same level as the
“Air” of Anaximenes and not a “symbol,” is clearly implied in such
passages as Arist. <cite>Met.</cite> Α, 3. 984 a 5. In support of the view that something
different from common fire is meant, Plato, <cite>Crat.</cite> 413 b, is sometimes
quoted; but a consideration of the context shows that the passage
will not bear this interpretation. Plato is discussing the derivation of δίκαιον
from δια-ιόν, and certainly δίκη was a prominent Herakleitean conception,
and a good deal that is here said may be the authentic doctrine of the
school. Sokrates goes on to complain that when he asks what this is which
“goes through” everything, he gets very inconsistent answers. One says
it is the sun. Another asks if there is no justice after sunset, and says it is
simply fire. A third says it is not fire itself, but the heat which is in fire.
A fourth identifies it with Mind. Now all we are entitled to infer from
this is that different accounts were given in the Herakleitean school.
These were a little less crude than the original doctrine of the master, but
for all that not one of them implies anything immaterial or symbolical.
The view that it was not fire itself, but Heat, which “passed through”
all things, is related to the theory of Herakleitos as Hippo’s Moisture is
related to the Water of Thales. It is quite likely, too, that some Herakleiteans
attempted to fuse the system of Anaxagoras with their own, just
as Diogenes of Apollonia tried to fuse it with that of Anaximenes. We
shall see, indeed, that we still have a work in which this attempt is made

<p class='c002'><a href='#r383'>383</a>. The presence of Herakleitean matter in this treatise was pointed out
by Gesner, but Bernays was the first to make any considerable use of it in
reconstructing the system. The older literature of the subject has been in
the main superseded by Carl Fredrichs’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Hippokratische Untersuchungen</cite></span>
(1899), where also a satisfactory text of the sections which concern us is
given for the first time. Fredrichs shows that (as I said already in the
first edition) the work belongs to the period of eclecticism and reaction
which I have briefly characterised in <a href='#sec184'>§ 184</a>, and he points out that c 3, which
was formerly supposed to be mainly Herakleitean, is really from some work
which was strongly influenced by Empedokles and Anaxagoras. I think,
however, that he goes wrong in attributing the section to a nameless
“Physiker” of the school of Archelaos, or even to Archelaos himself; it is
far more like what we should expect from the eclectic Herakleiteans whom
Plato describes in <cite>Crat.</cite> 413 c (see p. 161, <a href='#f374'><ins class='correction' title='n. 1'><i>n.</i> 374</ins></a>). He is certainly wrong in
holding the doctrine of the balance of fire and water not to be Herakleitean,
and there is no justification for separating the remark quoted in the text
from its context because it happens to agree almost verbally with the
beginning of c. 3. As we shall see, that passage too is of Herakleitean
origin.</p>

καὶ ἐλάχιστον· ἥλιος, σελήνη ἐπὶ τὸ μήκιστον καὶ ἐλάχιστον· πυρὸς ἔφοδος
καὶ ὕδατος. In any case, the meaning is the same, and the sentence
occurs between χωρεῖ δὲ πάντα καὶ θεῖα καὶ ἀνθρώπινα ἄνω καὶ κάτω
ἀμειβόμενα and πάντα ταὐτὰ καὶ οὐ τὰ αὐτά, which are surely Herakleitean
utterances.</p>

himself the words καὶ ψυχαὶ δὲ ἀπὸ τῶν ὑγρῶν ἀναθυμιῶνται, which are
found in Areios Didymos after fr. 42. I can hardly believe, however, that
the <em>word</em> ἀναθυμίασις is Herakleitean. He seems rather to have called the
two exhalations καπνός and ἀήρ (cf. fr. 37).</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#r387'>387</a>. We seem to have a clear reference to this in Epicharmos, fr. 2, Diels
(170 b, Kaibel): “Look now at men too. One grows and another passes
away, and all are in change always. What changes in its substance (κατὰ
φύσιν) and never abides in the same spot, will already be something different
from what has passed away. So thou and I were different yesterday, and
are now quite other people, and again we shall become others and never
the same again, and so on in the same way.” This is put into the mouth
of a debtor who does not wish to pay. See Bernays on the αὐξανόμενος

holds (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Forschungen</cite></span>, p. 78) that Ainesidemos really did combine
Herakleiteanism with Skepticism. Diels, on the other hand (<cite>Dox.</cite> pp.
210, 211), insists that Ainesidemos only gave an account of the theories of
Herakleitos. This controversy does not affect the use we make of the
passage.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#r391'>391</a>. We need not hesitate to ascribe to Herakleitos the view that the dead
become guardian demons of the living; it appears already in Hesiod,
<cite>Works and Days</cite>, 121, and the Orphic communities had popularised it.
Rohde, <cite>Psyche</cite> (pp. 442 sqq.), refused to admit that Herakleitos believed
the soul survived after death. Strictly speaking, it is no doubt an
inconsistency; but I believe, with Zeller and Diels, that it is one of a kind
we may well admit. Many thinkers have spoken of a personal immortality,
though there was really no room for it in their systems. It is worthy of
note in this connexion that the first argument which Plato uses to
establish the doctrine of immortality in the <cite>Phaedo</cite> is just the Herakleitean
parallelism of life and death with sleeping and waking.</p>

allows that it is from the same source as that quoted above (p. <a href='#Page_169'>169</a>), and,
as that comes from Περὶ διαίτης, i. 3, he denies the Herakleitean origin of
this too. He has not taken account of the fact that it gives the Stoic
doctrine, which raises a presumption in favour of that being Herakleitean.
If I could agree with Fredrichs’ theory, I should still say that the present

Mr. Adam allowed that no destruction of the world or conflagration
marked the end of Plato’s year, but he declined to draw what seems to me
the natural inference that the connexion between the two things belongs to
a later age, and should not, therefore, be ascribed to Herakleitos in the
absence of any evidence that he did so connect them. Nevertheless,
his treatment of these questions in the second volume of his edition of
the <cite>Republic</cite>, pp. 302 sqq., must form the basis of all further discussion on
the subject. It has certainly helped me to put the view which he rejects
(p. 303, n. 9) in what I hope will be found a more convincing form.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f400'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r400'>400</a>. This is certainly the general sense of the parallelism between the

to saying that it is eternal and changes its form, ὥσπερ εἴ τις ἐκ παιδὸς ἄνδρα
γιγνόμενον καὶ ἐξ ἀνδρὸς παῖδα ὁτὲ μὲν φθείρεσθαι, ὁτὲ δ’ εἶναι οἴοιτο (280 a

Corr.</cite> Β, 6. 334 a 1 sqq. What Aristotle finds fault with in both theories is
that they do not regard the substance of the heavens as something outside

<p class='c002'><a href='#r404'>404</a>. In his fifth edition (p. 699) Zeller seems to feel this last difficulty; for
he now says: “It is a contradiction which he, <em>and which probably Plato too</em>
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>und den wahrscheinlich auch Plato</i></span>) has not observed.” This seems to me
still less arguable. Plato may or may not be mistaken; but he makes the
perfectly definite statement that Herakleitos says ἀεί, while Empedokles
says ἐν μέρει. The Ionian Muses are called συντονώτεραι and the Sicilian
μαλακώτεραι just because the latter “lowered the pitch” (ἐχάλασαν) of the
doctrine that this is always so (τὸ ἀεὶ ταῦτα οὕτως ἔχειν).</p>

require γενήσεσθαι. Nor is there anything in his suggestion that ἅπαντα
(“not merely πάντα”) implies that all things become fire at once. In
Aristotle’s day, there was no distinction of meaning between πᾶς and ἅπας.
Even if he had said σύμπαντα, we could not press it. What is really
noticeable is the present infinitive γίνεσθαι which surely suggests a continuous

(p. 693 n.), this proves that some opponents of the Stoic ἐκπύρωσις tried
to withdraw the support of Herakleitos from it. Could they have done
so if Herakleitos had said anything about it, or would not some one
have produced a decisive quotation? We may be sure that, if any one

of the ἐκπύρωσις by saying that it is only a little one, and can last but a
moment; but the contradiction noted above remains all the same. Diels
holds that Herakleitos was “dark only in form,” and that “he himself
was perfectly clear as to the sense and scope of his ideas” (<cite>Herakleitos</cite>,

true Herakleitean ring. This, too, can hardly have had another author:
“They trust to their eyes rather than to their understanding, though their
eyes are not fit to judge even of the things that are seen. But I speak
these things from understanding.” These words are positively grotesque in
the mouth of the medical compiler; but we are accustomed to hear such
things from the Ephesian. Other examples which may be Herakleitean are
the image of the two men sawing wood—“one pushes, the other pulls”—and

Parmenides came to Athens in his sixty-fifth year,
accompanied by Zeno, and conversed with Sokrates,
who was then quite young. Now Sokrates was just
over seventy when he was put to death in 399 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>;
and therefore, if we suppose him to have been an
<em>ephebos</em>, that is, from eighteen to twenty years old,
at the time of his interview with Parmenides, we get
451-449 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> as the date of that event. I do not
hesitate to accept Plato’s statement,<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c014'><sup>[424]</sup></a> especially as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>we have independent evidence of the visit of Zeno

hand, depends solely on that of the foundation of Elea,
which he had adopted as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>floruit</cite></span> of Xenophanes.
Parmenides is born in that year, just as Zeno is born
in the year when Parmenides “flourished.” Why any
one should prefer these transparent combinations to
the testimony of Plato, I am at a loss to understand,
though it is equally a mystery why Apollodoros himself
should have overlooked such precise data.</p>

<p class='c002'>We have seen already (<a href='#sec55'>§ 55</a>) that Aristotle
mentions a statement which made Parmenides the
disciple of Xenophanes; but the value of this testimony
is diminished by the doubtful way in which
he speaks, and it is more than likely that he is
only referring to what Plato says in the <cite>Sophist</cite>.<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c014'><sup>[426]</sup></a>
It is, we also saw, very improbable that Xenophanes
founded the school of Elea, though it is quite possible
he visited that city. He tells us himself that, in his
ninety-second year, he was still wandering up and down
(fr. 8). At that time Parmenides would be well advanced
in life. And we must not overlook the statement
of Sotion, preserved to us by Diogenes, that, though
Parmenides “heard” Xenophanes, he did not “follow”
him. According to this account, our philosopher was
the “associate” of a Pythagorean, Ameinias, son of
Diochaitas, “a poor but noble man to whom he
afterwards built a shrine as to a hero.” It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Ameinias and not Xenophanes that “converted”
Parmenides to the philosophic life.<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c014'><sup>[427]</sup></a> This does not
read like an invention, and we must remember that the
Alexandrians had information about the history of
Southern Italy which we have not. The shrine erected
by Parmenides would still be there in later days, like
the grave of Pythagoras at Metapontion. It should
also be mentioned that Strabo describes Parmenides
and Zeno as Pythagoreans, and that Kebes talks of a
“Parmenidean and Pythagorean way of life.”<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c014'><sup>[428]</sup></a> Zeller
explains all this by supposing that, like Empedokles,
Parmenides approved of and followed the Pythagorean
mode of life without adopting the Pythagorean system.
It is possibly true that Parmenides believed in a
“philosophic life” (<a href='#sec35'>§ 35</a>), and that he got the idea
from the Pythagoreans; but there is very little
trace, either in his writings or in what we are told
about him, of his having been in any way affected
by the religious side of Pythagoreanism. The writing
of Empedokles is obviously modelled upon that of
Parmenides, and yet there is an impassable gulf between
the two. The touch of charlatanism, which is so
strange a feature in the copy, is altogether absent
from the model. It is true, no doubt, that there
are traces of Orphic ideas in the poem of Parmenides;<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c014'><sup>[429]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>but they are all to be found either in the allegorical
introduction or in the second part of the poem, and
we need not therefore take them very seriously. Now
Parmenides was a western Hellene, and he had
probably been a Pythagorean, so it is not a little
remarkable that he should be so free from the common
tendency of his age and country. It is here, if anywhere,
that we may trace the influence of Xenophanes.
As regards his relation to the Pythagorean system, we
shall have something to say later on. At present we
need only note further that, like most of the older
philosophers, he took part in politics; and Speusippos
recorded that he legislated for his native city. Others
add that the magistrates of Elea made the citizens
swear every year to abide by the laws which Parmenides
had given them.<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c014'><sup>[430]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The poem.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec85'></a>85. Parmenides was really the first philosopher to
expound his system in metrical language. As there is
some confusion on this subject, it deserves a few words
of explanation. In writing of Empedokles, Mr. J. A.
Symonds said: “The age in which he lived had not
yet thrown off the form of poetry in philosophical
composition. Even Parmenides had committed his
austere theories to hexameter verse.” Now this is
wrongly put. The earliest philosophers, Anaximander,
Anaximenes, and Herakleitos, all wrote in prose, and
the only Greeks who ever wrote philosophy in verse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>at all were just these two, Parmenides and Empedokles;
for Xenophanes was not primarily a philosopher
any more than Epicharmos. Empedokles copied
Parmenides; and he, no doubt, was influenced by
Xenophanes and the Orphics. But the thing was an
innovation, and one that did not maintain itself.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fragments of Parmenides are preserved for the
most part by Simplicius, who fortunately inserted them
in his commentary, because in his time the original
work was already rare.<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c014'><sup>[431]</sup></a> I follow the arrangement of

it was urged round by the whirling wheels at each end—gave

fetters and let anything come into being or pass away, but
holds it fast. Our judgment thereon depends on this: “<em>Is it</em>  <span class='linenum'>15</span>
or <em>is it not</em>?” Surely it is adjudged, as it needs must be,
that we are to set aside the one way as unthinkable and
nameless (for it is no true way), and that the other path is
real and true. How, then, can what <em>is</em> be going to be in the

its place; for hard necessity keeps it in the bonds of the
limit that holds it fast on every side. Wherefore it is not permitted

<div class='sidenote'>“It is.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec86'></a>86. In the First Part of his poem, we find
Parmenides chiefly interested to prove that <em>it is</em>; but
it is not quite obvious at first sight what it is precisely
that <em>is</em>. He says simply, <em>What is, is</em>. To us this does
not seem very clear, and that for two reasons. In the
first place, we should never think of doubting it, and
we cannot, therefore, understand why it should be
asserted with such iteration and vigour. In the second
place, we are accustomed to all sorts of distinctions
between different kinds and degrees of reality, and we
do not see which of these is meant. Such distinctions,
however, were quite unknown in those days. “That
which is,” with Parmenides, is primarily what, in
popular language, we call matter or body; only it is
not matter as distinguished from anything else. It is
certainly regarded as spatially extended; for it is quite
seriously spoken of as a sphere (fr. <a href='#Pa.8'>8</a>, 40). Moreover,
Aristotle tells us that Parmenides believed in none but
a sensible reality, which does not necessarily mean with
him a reality that is actually perceived by the senses,
but includes any which might be so perceived if the
senses were more perfect than they are.<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c014'><sup>[449]</sup></a> Parmenides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>does not say a word about “Being” anywhere.<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c014'><sup>[450]</sup></a> The
assertion that <em>it is</em> amounts just to this, that the
universe is a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenum</i></span>; and that there is no such thing
as empty space, either inside or outside the world.
From this it follows that there can be no such thing as
motion. Instead of endowing the One with an impulse
to change, as Herakleitos had done, and thus making
it capable of explaining the world, Parmenides dismissed
change as an illusion. He showed once for all
that if you take the One seriously you are bound to
deny everything else. All previous solutions of the
question, therefore, had missed the point. Anaximenes,
who thought to save the unity of the primary substance
by his theory of rarefaction and condensation, did not
observe that, by assuming there was less of what is in
one place than another, he virtually affirmed the existence
of what is not (fr. <a href='#Pa.8'>8</a>, 42). The Pythagorean
explanation implied that empty space or air existed
outside the world, and that it entered into it to separate
the units (<a href='#sec53'>§ 53</a>). It, too, assumes the existence of
what is not. Nor is the theory of Herakleitos any
more satisfactory; for it is based upon the contradiction
that fire both is and is not (fr. <a href='#Pa.6'>6</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>The allusion to Herakleitos in the verses last referred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>to has been doubted, though upon insufficient grounds.
Zeller points out quite rightly that Herakleitos never
says Being and not-Being are the same (the common
translation of fr. <a href='#An.6'>6</a>, <a href='#An.8'>8</a>); and, were there nothing more
than this, the reference might well seem doubtful.
The statement, however, that, according to the view in
question, “all things travel in opposite directions,” can
hardly be understood of anything but the “upward and
downward path” of Herakleitos (<a href='#sec71'>§ 71</a>). And, as we
have seen, Parmenides does not attribute the view that
Being and not-Being are the same to the philosopher
whom he is attacking; he only says that <em>it</em> is and is not,
the same and not the same.<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c014'><sup>[451]</sup></a> That is the natural
meaning of the words; and it furnishes a very accurate
description of the theory of Herakleitos.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The method of Parmenides.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec87'></a>87. The great novelty in the poem of Parmenides
is the method of argument. He first asks what is the
common presupposition of all the views with which he
has to deal, and he finds that this is the existence of
what is not. The next question is whether this can be
thought, and the answer is that it cannot. If you think
at all, you must think of something. Therefore there
is no nothing. Philosophy had not yet learned to
make the admission that a thing might be unthinkable
and nevertheless exist. Only that can be which can
be thought (fr. <a href='#Pa.5'>5</a>); for thought exists for the sake of
what is (fr. <a href='#Pa.8'>8</a>, 34).</p>

<p class='c002'>This method Parmenides carries out with the utmost
rigour. He will not have us pretend that we think
what we must admit to be unthinkable. It is true that
if we resolve to allow nothing but what we can understand,
we come into direct conflict with the evidence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>of our senses, which present us with a world of change
and decay. So much the worse for the senses, says
Parmenides. To many this will doubtless seem a
mistake on his part, but let us see what history has to
say on the point. The theory of Parmenides is the
inevitable outcome of a corporeal monism, and his bold
declaration of it ought to have destroyed that theory
for ever. If he had lacked courage to work out the
prevailing views of his time to their logical conclusion,
and to accept that conclusion, however paradoxical it
might seem to be, men might have gone on in the
endless circle of opposition, rarefaction and condensation,
one and many, for ever. It was the thorough-going
dialectic of Parmenides that made progress
possible. Philosophy must now cease to be monistic
or cease to be corporealist. It could not cease to be
corporealist; for the incorporeal was still unknown. It
therefore ceased to be monistic, and arrived at the
atomic theory, which, so far as we know, is the last
word of the view that the world is matter in motion.
Having worked out its problems on those conditions,
philosophy next attacked them on the other side. It
ceased to be corporealist, and found it possible to be
monistic once more, at least for a time. This progress
would have been impossible but for that faith in reason
which gave Parmenides the courage to reject as untrue
what was to him unthinkable, however strange the
result might be.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The results.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec88'></a>88. He goes on to develop all the consequences of
the admission that <em>it is</em>. It must be uncreated and
indestructible. It cannot have arisen out of nothing;
for there is no such thing as nothing. Nor can it have
arisen from something; for there is no room for anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>but itself. What is cannot have beside it any
empty space in which something else might arise; for
empty space is nothing, nothing cannot be thought, and
therefore cannot exist. What is, never came into being,
nor is anything going to come into being in the future.
“Is it or is it not?” If it is, then it is now, all at
once.</p>

<p class='c002'>That Parmenides was really denying the existence
of empty space was quite well known to Plato. He
says that Parmenides held “all things were one, and
that the one remains at rest in itself, <em>having no place in
which to move</em>.”<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c014'><sup>[452]</sup></a> Aristotle is no less clear. In the
<cite>de Caelo</cite> he lays it down that Parmenides was driven
to take up the position that the One was immovable
just because no one had yet imagined that there was
any reality other than sensible reality.<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c014'><sup>[453]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>That which is, is; and it cannot be more or less.
There is, therefore, as much of it in one place as in
another, and the world is a continuous, indivisible
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenum</i></span>. From this it follows at once that it must be
immovable. If it moved, it must move into an empty
space, and there is no empty space. It is hemmed in
by <em>what is</em>, by the real, on every side. For the same
reason, it must be finite, and can have nothing beyond
it. It is complete in itself, and has no need to stretch
out indefinitely into an empty space that does not exist.
Hence, too, it is spherical. It is equally real in every
direction, and the sphere is the only form which meets
this condition. Any other would <em>be</em> in one direction
more than in another. And this sphere cannot even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>move round its own axis; for there is nothing outside
of it with reference to which it could be said to move.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Parmenides the father of materialism.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec89'></a>89. To sum up. What <em>is</em>, is a finite, spherical,
motionless corporeal <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenum</i></span>, and there is nothing beyond
it. The appearances of multiplicity and motion, empty
space and time, are illusions. We see from this that
the primary substance of which the early cosmologists
were in search has now become a sort of “thing in
itself.” It never quite lost this character again. What
appears later as the elements of Empedokles, the so-called
“homoeomeries” of Anaxagoras and the atoms
of Leukippos and Demokritos, is just the Parmenidean
“being.” Parmenides is not, as some have said, the
“father of idealism”; on the contrary, all materialism
depends on his view of reality.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The beliefs of “mortals.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec90'></a>90. It is commonly said that, in the Second Part of
his poem, Parmenides offered a dualistic theory of the
origin of things as his own conjectural explanation of
the sensible world, or that, as Gomperz says, “What
he offered were the Opinions of Mortals; and this
description did not merely cover other people’s opinions.
It included his own as well, as far as they were not
confined to the unassailable ground of an apparent
philosophical necessity.”<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c014'><sup>[454]</sup></a> Now it is true that in one
place Aristotle appears to countenance a view of this
sort, but nevertheless it is an anachronism.<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c014'><sup>[455]</sup></a> Nor is it
really Aristotle’s view. He was perfectly well aware
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>that Parmenides did not admit the existence of “not-being”
in any degree whatever; but it was a natural
way speaking to call the cosmology of the Second
Part of the poem that of Parmenides. His hearers
would understand at once in what sense this was
meant. At any rate, the Peripatetic tradition was that
Parmenides, in the Second Part of the poem, meant
to give the belief of “the many.” This is how
Theophrastos put the matter, and Alexander seems to
have spoken of the cosmology as something which
Parmenides himself regarded as wholly false.<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c014'><sup>[456]</sup></a> The
other view comes from the Neoplatonists, and especially
Simplicius, who very naturally regarded the Way of
Truth as an account of the intelligible world, and the
Way of Opinion as a description of the sensible. It
need hardly be said that this is almost as great an
anachronism as the Kantian parallelism suggested by
Gomperz.<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c014'><sup>[457]</sup></a> Parmenides himself tells us in the most
unequivocal language that there is no truth at all in
the theory which he expounds, and he gives it merely
as the belief of “mortals.” It was this that led
Theophrastos to speak of it as the opinion of “the
many.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His explanation however, though preferable to that
of Simplicius, is not convincing either. “The many”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>are as far as possible from believing in an elaborate
dualism such as Parmenides expounded, and it is a
highly artificial hypothesis to assume that he wished
to show how the popular view of the world could best
be systematised.  “The many” would hardly be
convinced of their error by having their beliefs
presented to them in a form which they would certainly
fail to recognise. This, indeed, seems the most
incredible interpretation of all. It still, however, finds
adherents, so it is necessary to point out that the
beliefs in question are called “the opinions of mortals”
simply because the speaker is a goddess. Further,
we have to note that Parmenides forbids two ways of
research, and we have seen that the second of these,
which is also expressly ascribed to “mortals,” must be
the system of Herakleitos. We should surely expect,
then, to find that the other way too is the system of
some contemporary school, and it seems hard to
discover any of sufficient importance except the
Pythagorean. Now it is admitted by every one that
there are Pythagorean ideas in the Second Part of the
poem, and it is therefore to be presumed, in the absence
of evidence to the contrary, that the whole system
comes from the same source. It does not appear that
Parmenides said any more about Herakleitos than the
words to which we have just referred, in which he
forbids the second way of inquiry. He implies, indeed,
that there are really only two ways that can be thought
of, and that the attempt of Herakleitos to combine
them was futile.<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c014'><sup>[458]</sup></a> In any case, the Pythagoreans
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>were far more serious opponents at that date in Italy,
and it is certainly to them that we should expect
Parmenides to define his attitude.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is still not quite clear, however, why he should
have thought it worth while to put into hexameters a
view which he believed to be false. Here it becomes
important to remember that he had been a Pythagorean
himself, and that the poem is a renunciation of his
former beliefs. In such cases men commonly feel the
necessity of showing where their old views were wrong.
The goddess tells him that he must learn of those
beliefs also “how men ought to have judged that the
things which seem to them really are.”<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c014'><sup>[459]</sup></a> That is clear
so far; but it does not explain the matter fully. We
get a further hint in another place. He is to learn
these beliefs “in order that no opinion of mortals may
ever get the better of him” (fr. <a href='#Pa.8'>8</a>, 61). If we remember
that the Pythagorean system at this time was handed
down by oral tradition alone, we shall perhaps see
what this means. Parmenides was founding a dissident
school, and it was quite necessary for him to
instruct his disciples in the system they might be called
upon to oppose. In any case, they could not reject
it intelligently without a knowledge of it, and this
Parmenides had to supply himself.<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c014'><sup>[460]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The dualist cosmology.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span><a id='sec91'></a>91. The view that the Second Part of the poem
of Parmenides was a sketch of contemporary Pythagorean
cosmology is, doubtless, incapable of rigorous
demonstration, but it can, I think, be made extremely
probable. The entire history of Pythagoreanism up to
the end of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> is certainly conjectural;
but, if we find in Parmenides ideas which are wholly
unconnected with his own view of the world, and if we
find precisely the same ideas in later Pythagoreanism,
the most natural inference will surely be that the later
Pythagoreans derived these views from their predecessors,
and that they formed part of the original
stock-in-trade of the society to which they belonged.
This will only be confirmed if we find that they are
developments of certain features in the old Ionian
cosmology. Pythagoras came from Samos, which always
stood in the closest relations with Miletos; and it was
not, so far as we can see, in his cosmological views that
he chiefly displayed his originality. It has been pointed
out above (<a href='#sec53'>§ 53</a>) that the idea of the world breathing
came from Anaximenes, and we need not be surprised to
find traces of Anaximander as well. Now, if we were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>confined to what Aristotle tells us on this subject, it
would be almost impossible to make out a case; but
his statements require, as usual, to be examined with
a certain amount of care. He says, first of all, that the
two elements of Parmenides were the Warm and the
Cold.<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c014'><sup>[461]</sup></a> In this he is so far justified by the fragments
that, since the Fire of which Parmenides speaks is, of
course, warm, the other “form,” which has all the
opposite qualities, must of necessity be cold. But, nevertheless,
the habitual use of the terms “<em>the</em> warm” and
“<em>the</em> cold” is an accommodation to Aristotle’s own
system. In Parmenides himself they were simply one
pair of attributes amongst others.</p>

<p class='c002'>Still more misleading is Aristotle’s identification of
these with Fire and Earth. It is not quite certain that
he meant to say Parmenides himself made this identification;
but, on the whole, it is most likely that he did,
and <a id='corr213.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Theophastros'>Theophrastos</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_213.18'><ins class='correction' title='Theophastros'>Theophrastos</ins></a></span> certainly followed him in this.<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c014'><sup>[462]</sup></a> It is
another question whether it is accurate. Simplicius,
who had the poem before him (<a href='#sec85'>§ 85</a>), after mentioning
Fire and Earth, at once adds “or rather Light and
Darkness”;<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c014'><sup>[463]</sup></a> and this is suggestive enough. Lastly,
Aristotle’s identification of the dense element with
“what is not,”<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c014'><sup>[464]</sup></a> the unreal of the First Part of the poem,
is not very easy to reconcile with the view that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>earth. On the other hand, if we suppose that the
second of the two “forms,” the one which should not
have been “named,” is the Pythagorean Air or Void, we
get a very good explanation of Aristotle’s identification
of it with “what is not.” We seem, then, to be
justified in neglecting the identification of the dense
element with earth for the present. At a later stage,
we shall be able to see how it may have originated.<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c014'><sup>[465]</sup></a>
The further statement of Theophrastos, that the Warm
was the efficient cause and the Cold the material or
passive,<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c014'><sup>[466]</sup></a> is intelligible enough if we identify them with
the Limit and the Unlimited respectively; but is not,
of course, to be regarded as historical.</p>

<p class='c002'>We have seen that Simplicius, with the poem of
Parmenides before him, corrects Aristotle by substituting
Light and Darkness for Fire and Earth, and in this he
is amply borne out by the fragments which he quotes.
Parmenides himself calls one “form” Light, Flame, and
Fire, and the other Night, and we have now to consider
whether these can be identified with the Pythagorean
Limit and Unlimited. We have seen good reason to
believe (<a href='#sec58'>§ 58</a>) that the idea of the world breathing
belonged to the earliest form of Pythagoreanism, and
there can be no difficulty in identifying this “boundless
breath” with Darkness, which stands very well
for the Unlimited. “Air” or mist was always regarded
as the dark element.<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c014'><sup>[467]</sup></a> And that which gives definiteness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>to the vague darkness is certainly light or fire,
and this may account for the prominence given to that
element by Hippasos.<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c014'><sup>[468]</sup></a> We may probably conclude,
then, that the Pythagorean distinction between the
Limit and the Unlimited, which we shall have to
consider later (Chap. VII.), made its first appearance in
this crude form. If, on the other hand, we identify
darkness with the Limit, and light with the Unlimited,
as most critics do, we get into insuperable difficulties.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The heavenly bodies.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec92'></a>92. We must now look at the general cosmical view
expounded in the Second Part of the poem. The
fragments are scanty, and the doxographical tradition
hard to interpret; but enough remains to show that
here, too, we are on Pythagorean ground. All
discussion of the subject must start from the following
important passage of Aetios:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Parmenides held that there were crowns crossing one
another<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c014'><sup>[469]</sup></a> and encircling one another, formed of the rare and
the dense element respectively, and that between these there
were other mixed crowns made up of light and darkness.
That which surrounds them all was solid like a wall, and
under it is a fiery crown. That which is in the middle of all
the crowns is also solid, and surrounded in turn by a fiery
circle. The central circle of the mixed crowns is the cause
of movement and becoming to all the rest. He calls it
“the goddess who directs their course,” “the Holder of Lots,”
and “Necessity.” Aet. ii. 7. 1 (R. P. 126).</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The “crowns.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec93'></a>93. The first thing we have to observe is that it is
quite unjustifiable to regard these “crowns” as spheres.
The word στέφαναι can mean “rims” or “brims” or
anything of that sort, but it seems incredible that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>should be used of spheres. It does not appear, either,
that the solid circle which surrounds all the crowns is
to be regarded as spherical. The expression “like a
wall” would be highly inappropriate in that case.
We seem, then, to be face to face with something of the
same kind as the “wheels” of Anaximander, and
it is obviously quite likely that Pythagoras should
have taken this theory from him. Nor is evidence
altogether lacking that the Pythagoreans did regard the
heavenly bodies in this way. In Plato’s Myth of Er,
which is certainly Pythagorean in its general character,
we do not hear of spheres, but of the “lips” of
concentric whorls fitted into one another like a nest of
boxes.<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c014'><sup>[470]</sup></a> Even in the <cite>Timaeus</cite> there are no spheres,
but bands or strips crossing each other at an angle.<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c014'><sup>[471]</sup></a>
Lastly, in the Homeric <cite>Hymn to Ares</cite>, which seems to
have been composed under Pythagorean influence, the
word used for the orbit of the planet is ἄντυξ, which
must mean “rim.”<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c014'><sup>[472]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The fact is, there is really no evidence that any one
ever adopted the theory of celestial spheres at all, till
Aristotle turned the geometrical construction which
Eudoxos had set up as a hypothesis “to save
appearances” (σῴζειν τὰ φαινόμενα ) into real things.<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c014'><sup>[473]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>From that time forward we hear a great deal about
spheres, and it was natural that later writers should
attribute them to the Pythagoreans; but there is no
occasion to do violence to the language of Parmenides by
turning his “crowns” into anything of the sort. At this
date, spheres would not have served to explain anything
that could not be explained more simply without them.</p>

<p class='c002'>We are next told that these “crowns” encircle one
another or are folded over one another, and that they
are made of the rare and the dense element. We
also learn that between them are “mixed crowns”
made up of light and darkness. Now it is to be
observed, in the first place, that light and darkness are
exactly the same thing as the rare and the dense, and
it looks as if there was some confusion here. It may
be doubted whether these statements are based on
anything else than fr. <a href='#Pa.12'>12</a>, which might certainly be
interpreted to mean that between the crowns of fire
there were crowns of night with a portion of fire in
them. That may be right; but I think it is rather
more natural to understand the passage as saying that
the narrower circles are surrounded by wider circles of
night, each with its portion of fire rushing in the midst
of it. These last words would then be a simple
repetition of the statement that the narrower circles
are filled with unmixed fire,<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c014'><sup>[474]</sup></a> and we should have a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>fairly exact reproduction of the planetary system of
Anaximander. It is, however, possible, though I think
less likely, that Parmenides represented the space
between the circles as occupied by similar rings in
which the fire and darkness were mixed instead of
having the fire enclosed in the darkness.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The goddess.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec94'></a>94. “In the middle of those,” says Parmenides,
“is the goddess who steers the course of all things.”
Aetios, that is, Theophrastos, explains this to mean in
the middle of the mixed crowns, while Simplicius
declares that it means in the middle of all the crowns,
that is to say, in the centre of the world.<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c014'><sup>[475]</sup></a> It is not
very likely that either of them had anything better to
go upon than the words of Parmenides just quoted, and
these are ambiguous. Simplicius, as is clear from the
language he uses, identified this goddess with the
Pythagorean Hestia or central fire, while Theophrastos
could not do this, because he knew and stated that
Parmenides held the earth to be round and in the
centre of the world.<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c014'><sup>[476]</sup></a> In this very passage we are told
that what is in the middle of all the crowns is solid.
The data furnished by Theophrastos, in fact, exclude
the identification of the goddess with the central fire
altogether. We cannot say that what is in the middle
of <em>all</em> the crowns is solid, and that under it there is
again a fiery crown.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c014'><sup>[477]</sup></a> Nor does it seem fitting to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>relegate a goddess to the middle of a solid spherical
earth. We must try to find a place for her elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c002'>We are further told by Aetios that this goddess was
called Ananke and the “Holder of Lots.”<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c014'><sup>[478]</sup></a> We know
already that she steers the course of all things, that is,
that she regulates the motions of the celestial crowns.
Simplicius adds, unfortunately without quoting the
actual words, that she sends souls at one time from
the light to the unseen world, at another from the
unseen world to the light.<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c014'><sup>[479]</sup></a> It would be difficult to
describe more exactly what the goddess does in the
Myth of Er, and so here once more we seem to be on
Pythagorean ground. It is to be noticed further that
in fr. <a href='#Pa.10'>10</a> we read how Ananke took the heavens and
compelled them to hold fast the fixed courses of the
stars, and that in fr. <a href='#Pa.12'>12</a> we are told that she is the
beginner of all pairing and birth. Lastly, in fr. <a href='#Pa.13'>13</a> we
hear that she created Eros first of all the gods. Modern
parallels are dangerous, but it is not really going much
beyond what is written to say that this Eros is the Will
to Live, which leads to successive rebirths of the soul.
So we shall find that in Empedokles it is an ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>oracle or decree of Ananke that causes the gods to fall
and become incarnate in a cycle of births.<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c014'><sup>[480]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>We should, then, be more certain of the place which
this goddess occupies in the universe if we could be
quite sure where Ananke is in the Myth of Er.
Without, however, raising that vexed question, we may
lay down with some confidence that, according to
Theophrastos, she occupied a position midway between
the earth and the heavens. Whether we believe in the
“mixed crowns” or not makes no difference in this
respect; for the statement of Aetios that she was in
the middle of the mixed crowns undoubtedly implies
that she was in that region. Now she is identified with
one of the crowns in a somewhat confused passage of
Cicero,<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c014'><sup>[481]</sup></a> and we have seen above (p. <a href='#Page_69'>69</a>) that the whole
theory of wheels or crowns was probably suggested by
the Milky Way. It seems to me, therefore, that we
must think of the Milky Way as a crown intermediate
between the crowns of the Sun and the Moon, and this
agrees very well with the prominent way in which it is
mentioned in fr. <a href='#Pa.11'>11</a>. It is better not to be too
positive about the other details of the system, though it
is interesting to notice that according to some it was
Pythagoras, and according to others Parmenides, who
discovered the identity of the evening and morning
star. That fits in exactly with our general view.<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c014'><sup>[482]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Besides all this, it is quite certain that Parmenides
went on to describe how the other gods were born and
how they fell, an idea which we know to be Orphic,
and which may well have been Pythagorean. We
shall come to it again in Empedokles. In Plato’s
<cite>Symposium</cite>, Agathon couples Parmenides with Hesiod
as a narrator of ancient deeds of violence committed
by the gods.<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c014'><sup>[483]</sup></a> If Parmenides was expounding the
Pythagorean theology, all this is just what we should
expect; but it seems hopeless to explain it on any
of the other theories which have been advanced on
the purpose of the Way of Belief. Such things do
not follow naturally from the ordinary view of the
world, and we have no reason to suppose that
Herakleitos expounded his views of the upward and
downward path of the soul in this form. He certainly
did hold that the guardian spirits entered into human
bodies; but the whole point of his theory was that he
gave a naturalistic rather than a theological account
of the process. Still less can we think it probable
that Parmenides made up these stories himself in
order to show what the popular view of the world
really implied if properly formulated. We must ask,
I think, that any theory on the subject shall account
for what was evidently no inconsiderable portion of
the poem.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Physiology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec95'></a>95. In describing the views of his contemporaries,
Parmenides was obliged, as we see from the fragments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>to say a good deal about physiological matters. Like
everything else, man was composed of the warm and
the cold, and death was caused by the removal of the
warm. Some curious views with regard to generation
were also stated. In the first place, males came from
the right side and females from the left. Women had
more of the warm and men of the cold, a view which
we shall find Empedokles contradicting.<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c014'><sup>[484]</sup></a> It is just
the proportion of the warm and cold in men that
determines the character of their thought, so that
even corpses, from which the warm has been removed,
retain a perception of what is cold and dark.<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c014'><sup>[485]</sup></a> These
fragments of information do not tell us much when
taken by themselves; but they connect themselves
in a most interesting way with the history of medicine,
and point to the fact that one of its leading schools
stood in close relation with the Pythagorean Society.
Even before the days of Pythagoras, we know that
Kroton was famous for its doctors. A Krotoniate,
Demokedes, was court physician to the Persian king,
and married Milo the Pythagorean’s daughter.<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c014'><sup>[486]</sup></a> We
also know the name of a very distinguished medical
writer who lived at Kroton in the days between
Pythagoras and Parmenides, and the few facts we are
told about him enable us to regard the physiological
views described by Parmenides not as isolated
curiosities, but as landmarks by means of which we
can trace the origin and growth of one of the most
influential of medical theories, that which explains
health as a balance of opposites.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Alkmaion of Kroton.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span><a id='sec96'></a>96. Aristotle tells us that Alkmaion of Kroton<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c014'><sup>[487]</sup></a> was
a young man in the old age of Pythagoras. He does
not actually say, as later writers do, that he was a
Pythagorean, though he points out that he seems
either to have derived his theory of opposites from
the Pythagoreans or they theirs from him.<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c014'><sup>[488]</sup></a> In any
case, he was intimately connected with the society,
as is proved by one of the scanty fragments of his
book. It began as follows: “Alkmaion of Kroton,
son of Peirithous, spoke these words to Brotinos and
Leon and Bathyllos. As to things invisible and things
mortal, the gods have certainty; but, so far as men
may infer ...”<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c014'><sup>[489]</sup></a> The quotation unfortunately ends
in this abrupt way, but we learn two things from it.
In the first place, Alkmaion possessed that reserve
which marks all the best Greek medical writers; and
in the second place, he dedicated his work to the heads
of the Pythagorean Society.<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c014'><sup>[490]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Alkmaion’s chief importance in the history of
philosophy really lies in the fact that he is the founder
of empirical psychology.<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c014'><sup>[491]</sup></a> It is certain that he regarded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>the brain as the common sensorium, an important
discovery which Hippokrates and Plato adopted from
him, though Empedokles, Aristotle, and the Stoics
reverted to the more primitive view that the heart
performs this function. There is no reason to doubt
that he made this discovery by anatomical means.
We have some authority for saying that he practised
dissection, and, though the nerves were not yet recognised
as such, it was known that there were certain
“passages” which might be prevented from communicating
sensations to the brain by lesions.<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c014'><sup>[492]</sup></a> He
also distinguished between sensation and understanding,
though we have no means of knowing exactly where he
drew the line between them. His theories of the special
senses are of great interest. We find in him already,
what is characteristic of Greek theories of vision as a
whole, the attempt to combine the view of vision as an act
proceeding from the eye with that which attributes it to
an image reflected in the eye. He knew the importance of
air for the sense of hearing, though he called it the void, a
thoroughly Pythagorean touch. With regard to the other
senses, our information is more scanty, but sufficient to
show that he treated the subject systematically.<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c014'><sup>[493]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>His astronomy seems surprisingly crude for one
who stood in close relations with the Pythagoreans.
We are told that he adopted Anaximenes’ theory
of the sun and Herakleitos’s explanation of eclipses.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c014'><sup>[494]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>It is all the more remarkable that he is credited with
originating the idea, which it required all Plato’s
authority to get accepted later, that the planets have
an orbital motion in the opposite direction to the
diurnal revolution of the heavens.<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c014'><sup>[495]</sup></a> This, if true,
probably stood in close connexion with his saying
that soul was immortal because it resembled immortal
things, and was always in motion like the heavenly
bodies.<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c014'><sup>[496]</sup></a> He seems, in fact, to be the real author
of the curious view which Plato put into the mouth
of the Pythagorean Timaios, that the soul has circles
revolving just as the heavens and the planets do. This
too seems to be the explanation of his further statement
that man dies because he cannot join the
beginning to the end.<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c014'><sup>[497]</sup></a> The orbits of the heavenly
bodies always come full circle, but the circles in the
head may fail to complete themselves. This new
version of the parallelism between the microcosm
and the macrocosm would be perfectly natural for
Alkmaion, though it is, of course, no more than a
playful fancy to Plato.</p>

<p class='c002'>Alkmaion’s theory of health as “isonomy” is at
once that which most clearly connects him with earlier
inquirers like Anaximander, and also that which had
the greatest influence on the subsequent development
of philosophy. He observed, to begin with, that “most
things human were two,” and by this he meant that
man was made up of the hot and the cold, the moist and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the dry, and the rest of the opposites.<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c014'><sup>[498]</sup></a> Disease was
just the “monarchy” of any one of these—the same
thing that Anaximander had called “injustice”—while
health was the establishment in the body of
a free government with equal laws.<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c014'><sup>[499]</sup></a> This was the
leading doctrine of the Sicilian school of medicine
which came into existence not long after, and we
shall have to consider in the sequel its influence
on the development of Pythagoreanism. Taken along
with the theory of “pores,”<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c014'><sup>[500]</sup></a> it is of the greatest
importance for later science.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#r434'>434</a>. I read μῦθος as in the parallel passage fr. 8 <i>ad init.</i> Diels’s interpretation

νοεῖν ἔστιν τε καὶ εἶναι. Apart from the philosophical anachronism of
making Parmenides say that “thought and being are the same,” it is a
grammatical anachronism to make him use the infinitive (with or without
the article) as the subject of a sentence. On the other hand, he does use
the active infinitive after εἶναι in the construction where we usually use a
passive infinitive (Monro, <cite>H. Gr.</cite> § 231 <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>sub fin.</i></span>). Cf. fr. 4, εἰσὶ νοῆσαι, “are
for thinking,” <i>i.e.</i> “can be thought.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f436'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r436'>436</a>. The construction here is the same as that explained in the last note.
It is surprising that good scholars should acquiesce in the translation of τὸ
λέγειν τε νοεῖν τε as “to say and think this.” Then ἔστι γὰρ εἶναι means
“it can be,” not “being is,” and the last phrase should be construed
οὐκ ἔστι μηδὲν (εἶναι).</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f437'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r437'>437</a>. I construe οἷς νενόμισται τὸ πέλειν τε καὶ οὐκ εἶναι ταὐτὸν καὶ οὐ
ταὐτόν. The subject of the infinitives πέλειν καὶ οὐκ εἶναι is the <em>it</em>, which
has to be supplied also with ἔστιν and οὐκ ἔστιν. This way of taking the
words makes it unnecessary to believe that Parmenides said (τὸ) οὐκ εἶναι
instead of (τὸ) μὴ εἶναι for “not-being.” There is no difference between
πέλειν and εἶναι except in rhythmical value.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f438'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r438'>438</a>. I take πάντων as neuter and understand παλίντροπος κέλευθος as
equivalent to the ὁδὸς ἄνω κάτω of Herakleitos. I do not think it has
anything to do with the παλίντονος (or παλίντροπος) ἁρμονίη. See Chap.

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f439'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r439'>439</a>. I still prefer to read ἔστι γὰρ οὐλομελές with Plutarch (<cite>adv. Col.</cite>
1114 c). Proklos (<cite>in Parm.</cite> 1152, 24) also read οὐλομελές. Simplicius,
who has μουνογενές here, calls the One of Parmenides ὁλομελές elsewhere
(<cite>Phys.</cite> p. 137, 15). The reading of [Plut.] <cite>Strom.</cite> 5, μοῦνον μουνογενές
helps to explain the confusion. We have only to suppose that the letters
μ, ν, γ were written above the line in the Academy copy of Parmenides
by some one who had <cite>Tim.</cite> 31 b 3 in mind.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f440'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r440'>440</a>. Diels formerly read ἔκ πη ἐόντος, “from that which in any way is”;
but he has now reverted to the reading ἔκ μὴ ἐόντος, supposing that the
other horn of the dilemma has dropped out. In any case, “nothing but
what is not can arise from what is not” gives a perfectly good sense.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f441'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r441'>441</a>. For the difficulties which have been felt about μᾶλλον here, see Diels’s
note. If the word is to be pressed, his interpretation is admissible; but it
seems to me that this is simply an instance of “polar expression.” It is
true that it is only the case of there being less of what is in one place than
another that is important for the divisibility of the One; but if there is less
in one place, there is more in another <em>than in that place</em>. The Greek
language tends to express these implications. The position of the relative
clause makes a difficulty for us, but hardly for a Greek.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f442'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r442'>442</a>. Simplicius certainly read μὴ ἐὸν δ’ ἂν παντὸς ἐδεῖτο, which is metrically
impossible. I followed Bergk in deleting μή, and have interpreted
with Zeller. So too Diels.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f443'>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f444'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r444'>444</a>. As Diels rightly points out, the Ionic φατίζειν is equivalent to
ὀνομάζειν. The meaning, I think, is this. We may name things as we
choose, but there can be no thought corresponding to a name that is not
the name of something real.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f445'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r445'>445</a>. This is Zeller’s way of taking the words, and still seems to me the
best. Diels objects that ἑτέρην would be required, and renders <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>nur eine
derselben, das sei unerlaubt</i></span>, giving the words to the “mortals.” This
seems to me to involve more serious grammatical difficulties than the use
of μίαν for τὴν ἑτέραν, which is quite legitimate when there is an emphasis
on the number. Aristotle must have taken it so; for he infers that one of
the μορφαί is to be identified with τὸ ἐόν.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f447'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r447'>447</a>. This fragment of the theory of knowledge which was expounded in
the second part of the poem of Parmenides must be taken in connexion with
what we are told by Theophrastos in the “Fragment on Sensation” (<cite>Dox.</cite>
p. 499; cf. p. 222). It appears from this that he said the character of
men’s thought depended upon the preponderance of the light or the dark

too can we think that a teacher of wisdom taught his disciples nothing
as to the way in which they must take the existing sensible world, even
if only as a deception?” This implies (1) that the distinction between
Appearance and Reality had been clearly grasped; and (2) that a certain
hypothetical and relative truth was allowed to Appearance. These are
palpable anachronisms. Both views are Platonic, and they were not held
even by Plato in his earlier writings.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#r459'>459</a>. I read χρῆν δοκιμῶσ’ εἶναι in fr. 1, 32 with Diels, but I do not feel
able to accept his rendering <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>wie man bei gründlicher Durchforschung
annehmen müsste, dass sich jenes Scheinwesen verhalte</i></span>. We must, I
think, take χρῆν δοκιμῶσαι (<i>i.e.</i> δοκιμάσαι) quite strictly, and χρῆν with the
infinitive means “ought to have.” The most natural subject for the
infinitive in that case is βροτούς, while εἶναι will be dependent on δοκιμῶσαι,
and have τὰ δοκοῦντα for its subject. This way of taking the words is
confirmed by fr. <a href='#Pa.8'>8</a>, 54, τῶν μίαν οὐ χρεών ἐστιν, if taken as I have taken
it with Zeller. See above, p. 201, <a href='#f445'><ins class='correction' title='n. 1'><i>n.</i> 445</ins></a>.</p>

<p class='c002'><a href='#r460'>460</a>. The view that the opinions contained in the Second Part are those of
others, and are not given as true in any sense whatsoever, is that of Diels.
The objections of Wilamowitz (<cite>Hermes</cite>, xxxiv. pp. 203 sqq.) do not appear
to me cogent. If we interpret him rightly, Parmenides never says that
“this hypothetical explanation is ... better than that of any one else”
(E. Meyer, iv. § 510, <cite>Anm.</cite>). What he does say is that it is untrue
altogether. It <a id='corr212.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='seem'>seems</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_212.26'><ins class='correction' title='seem'>seems</ins></a></span> to me, however, that Diels has weakened his case by
refusing to identify the theory here expounded with Pythagoreanism, and
referring it mainly to Herakleitos. Herakleitos was emphatically <em>not</em> a
dualist, and I cannot see that to represent him as one is even what Diels
calls a “caricature” of his theory. Caricatures must have some point
of likeness. It is still more surprising to me that Patin, who makes
ἓν πάντα εἶναι the corner-stone of Herakleiteanism, should adopt this view
(<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Parmenides im Kampfe gegen Heraklit</cite></span>, 1899). E. Meyer (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
seems to think that the fact of Zeno’s having modified the δόξα of
Parmenides in an Empedoklean sense (Diog. ix. 29; R. P. 140) proves
that it was supposed to have some sort of truth. On the contrary, it would
only show, if true, that Zeno had other opponents to face than Parmenides
had.</p>

to observe that Mr. Adam also gets into the interior of the earth in his
interpretation of the Myth of Er. It is instructive, too, because it shows
that we are really dealing with the same order of ideas. The most heroic
attempt to save the central fire for Pythagoras was my own hypothesis of
an annular earth (1st ed. p. 203). This has met with well-deserved
ridicule; but all the same it is the only possible solution on these lines.

<div class='sidenote'>Pluralism.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec97'></a>97. The belief that all things are one was common
to the philosophers we have hitherto studied; but
now Parmenides has shown that, if this one thing
really <em>is</em>, we must give up the idea that it can take
different forms. The senses, which present to us a
world of change and multiplicity, are deceitful. From
this there was no escape; the time was still to come
when men would seek the unity of the world in
something which, from its very nature, the senses could
never perceive.</p>

<p class='c002'>We find, accordingly, that from the time of
Parmenides to that of Plato, all thinkers in whose
hands philosophy made real progress abandoned the
monistic hypothesis. Those who still held by it
adopted a critical attitude, and confined themselves
to a defence of the theory of Parmenides against the
new views. Others taught the doctrine of Herakleitos
in an exaggerated form; some continued to expound
the systems of the early Milesians. This, of course,
showed want of insight; but even those thinkers who
saw that Parmenides could not be left unanswered,
were by no means equal to their predecessors in power
and thoroughness. The corporealist hypothesis had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>proved itself unable to bear the weight of a monistic
structure; but a thorough-going pluralism such as the
atomic theory might have some value, if not as a
final explanation of the world, yet at least as an
intelligible view of a part of it. Any pluralism, on
the other hand, which, like that of Empedokles and
Anaxagoras, stops short of the atoms, will achieve no
permanent result, however many may be the brilliant
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>aperçus</em></span> which it embodies. It will remain an attempt
to reconcile two things that cannot be reconciled,

in no way bound to believe that he was just forty years
old at the time of the event in his life which can
most easily be dated. That is the assumption made
by Apollodoros; but there are reasons for thinking
that his date is too late by some eight or ten years.<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c014'><sup>[504]</sup></a>
It is, indeed, most likely that Empedokles did not go
to Thourioi till after his banishment from Akragas,
and he may well have been more than forty years old
when that happened. All, therefore, we can be said
to know of his date is, that his grandfather was still
alive in 496 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; that he himself was active at
Akragas after 472, the date of Theron’s death; and
that he died later than 444.</p>

<p class='c002'>Even these indications are enough to show that
he must have been a boy in the reign of Theron,
the tyrant who co-operated with Gelon of Syracuse
in the repulse of the Carthaginians from Himera.
His son and successor, Thrasydaios, was a man of
another stamp. Before his accession to the throne
of Akragas, he had ruled in his father’s name at
Himera, and completely estranged the affections of its
inhabitants. Theron died in 472 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and Thrasydaios
at once displayed all the vices and follies usual in
the second holder of a usurped dominion. After a
disastrous war with Hieron of Syracuse, he was driven
out; and Akragas enjoyed a free government till it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>fell before the Carthaginians more than half a century
later.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c014'><sup>[505]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Empedokles as a politician.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec99'></a>99. In the political events of the next few years,
Empedokles certainly played an important part; but
our information on the subject is of a very curious
kind. The Sicilian historian Timaios told one or
two stories about him, which are obviously genuine
traditions picked up about a hundred and fifty years
afterwards; but, like all popular traditions, they are
a little confused. The picturesque incidents are
remembered, but the essential parts of the story
are dropped. Still, we may be thankful that the
“collector of old wives’ tales,”<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c014'><sup>[506]</sup></a> as sneering critics
called him, has enabled us to measure the historical
importance of Empedokles for ourselves by showing
us how he was pictured by the great-grandchildren
of his contemporaries.</p>

<p class='c002'>We read, then,<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c014'><sup>[507]</sup></a> that once he was invited to sup
with one of the “rulers.” Tradition delights in such
vague titles. “Supper was well advanced, but no
wine was brought in. The rest of the company said
nothing, but Empedokles was righteously indignant, and
insisted on wine being served. The host, however,
said he was waiting for the serjeant of the Council.
When that official arrived, he was appointed ruler of
the feast. The host, of course, appointed him.
Thereupon he began to give hints of an incipient
tyranny. He ordered the company either to drink or
have the wine poured over their heads. At the time,
Empedokles said nothing; but next day he led both
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>of them before the court, and had them condemned
and put to death—both the man who asked him to
supper, and the ruler of the feast.<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c014'><sup>[508]</sup></a> This was the
beginning of his political career.” The next tale is
that Empedokles prevented the Council from granting
his friend Akron a piece of land for a family sepulchre
on the ground of his eminence in medicine, and
supported his objection by a punning epigram.<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c014'><sup>[509]</sup></a>
Lastly, he broke up the assembly of the Thousand—perhaps
some oligarchical association or club.<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c014'><sup>[510]</sup></a> It
may have been for this that he was offered the kingship,
which Aristotle tells us he refused.<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c014'><sup>[511]</sup></a> At any
rate, we see that Empedokles was the great democratic
leader at Akragas in those days, though we have no
clear knowledge of what he did.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Empedokles as a religious teacher.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec100'></a>100. But there is another side to his public character
which Timaios found it hard to reconcile with his
political views. He claimed to be a god, and to
receive the homage of his fellow-citizens in that capacity.
The truth is, Empedokles was not a mere statesman;
he had a good deal of the “medicine-man” about him.
According to Satyros,<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c014'><sup>[512]</sup></a> Gorgias affirmed that he had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>been present when his master was performing sorceries.
We can see what this means from the fragments of
the <cite>Purifications</cite>. Empedokles was a preacher of the
new religion which sought to secure release from the
“wheel of birth” by purity and abstinence; but it is
not quite certain to which form of it he adhered. On
the one hand, Orphicism seems to have been strong at
Akragas in the days of Theron, and there are even
some verbal coincidences between the poems of
Empedokles and the Orphicising Odes which Pindar
addressed to that prince.<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c014'><sup>[513]</sup></a> There are also some points
of similarity between the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Rhapsodic Theogony</cite></span>, as we
know it from Damaskios, and certain fragments of
Empedokles, though the importance of these has been
exaggerated.<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c014'><sup>[514]</sup></a> On the other hand, there is no reason
to doubt the statement of Ammonios that fr. <a href='#Em.134'>134</a>
refers to Apollo;<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c014'><sup>[515]</sup></a> and, if that is so, it would point
to his having been an adherent of the Ionic form of
the mystic doctrine, as we have seen (<a href='#sec39'>§ 39</a>) that
Pythagoras was. Further, Timaios already knew the
story that he had been expelled from the Pythagorean
Order for “stealing discourses,”<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c014'><sup>[516]</sup></a> and it is probable on
the whole that fr. <a href='#Em.129'>129</a> refers to Pythagoras.<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c014'><sup>[517]</sup></a> It would
be very hazardous to dogmatise on this subject; but
it seems most likely that Empedokles had been
influenced by Orphic ideas in his youth, and that, in
later life, he preached a form of Pythagoreanism which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>was not considered orthodox by the heads of the
Society. In any case, it seems far more probable that
his political and scientific activity belong to the same
period of his life, and that he only became a wandering
prophet after his banishment, than that his scientific
work belonged to his later days when he was a solitary
exile.<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c014'><sup>[518]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>We hear of a number of marvels performed by
Empedokles, which are for the most part nothing but
inferences from his writings. Timaios told how he
weakened the force of the etesian winds by hanging
bags of asses’ skins on the trees to catch them. He
had certainly said, in his exaggerated way, that the
knowledge of science as taught by him would enable
his disciples to control the winds (fr. <a href='#Em.111'>111</a>); and this,
along with the fabled windbags of Aiolos, is enough
to account for the tale.<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c014'><sup>[519]</sup></a> We are also told how he
brought back to life a woman who had been breathless
and pulseless for thirty days. The verse where he
asserts that his teaching will enable Pausanias to bring
the dead back from Hades (fr. <a href='#Em.111'>111</a>) shows how this
story may have arisen.<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c014'><sup>[520]</sup></a> Again, we hear that he
sweetened the pestilent marsh between Selinous and
the sea by diverting the rivers Hypsas and Selinos
into it. We know from coins that this purification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>of the marshes actually took place, but we may doubt
whether it was attributed to Empedokles till a later
time.<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c014'><sup>[521]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Rhetoric and medicine.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec101'></a>101. Aristotle said that Empedokles was the
inventor of Rhetoric;<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c014'><sup>[522]</sup></a> and Galen made him the founder
of the Italian school of Medicine, which he puts on a
level with those of Kos and Knidos.<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c014'><sup>[523]</sup></a> Both these
statements must be considered in connexion with his
political and scientific activity. It seems to be certain
that Gorgias was his disciple in physics and medicine,
and some of the peculiarities which marked his style
are to be found in the poems of Empedokles.<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c014'><sup>[524]</sup></a> It is
not to be supposed, of course, that Empedokles wrote
a formal treatise on Rhetoric; but it is in every way
probable, and in accordance with his character, that
the speeches, of which he must have made many, were
marked by that euphuism which Gorgias introduced
to Athens at a later date, and which gave rise to the
idea of an artistic prose. The influence of Empedokles
on the development of medicine was, however, far
more important, as it affected not only medicine itself,
but through it, the whole tendency of scientific and
philosophical thinking. It has been said that
Empedokles had no successors,<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c014'><sup>[525]</sup></a> and the remark is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>true if we confine ourselves strictly to philosophy.
On the other hand, the medical school which he
founded was still living in the days of Plato, and it
had considerable influence on him, and still more on
Aristotle.<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c014'><sup>[526]</sup></a> Its fundamental doctrine was the identification
of the four elements with the hot and the cold,
the moist and the dry. It also held that we breathe
through all the pores of the body, and that the act of
respiration is closely connected with the motion of the
blood. The heart, not the brain, was regarded as the
organ of consciousness.<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c014'><sup>[527]</sup></a> A more external characteristic
of the medicine taught by the followers of
Empedokles is that they still clung to ideas of a
magical nature. A protest against this by a member
of the Koan school has been preserved. He refers to
them as “magicians and purifiers and charlatans and
quacks, who profess to be very religious.”<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c014'><sup>[528]</sup></a> Though
there is some truth in this, it hardly does justice to
the great advances in physiology that were due to the
Sicilian school.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Relation to predecessors.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec102'></a>102. In the biography of Empedokles, we hear
very little of his theory of nature. The only hints we
get are some statements about his teachers. Alkidamas,
who had good opportunities of knowing, made him a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>fellow-student of Zeno under Parmenides. That is
both possible and likely. Theophrastos too made him
a follower and imitator of Parmenides. But the further
statement that he had “heard” Pythagoras cannot be
right. Probably Alkidamas said “Pythagoreans.”<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c014'><sup>[529]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Some writers hold that certain parts of the system
of Empedokles, in particular the theory of pores and
effluvia (<a href='#sec118'>§ 118</a>), which do not seem to follow very
naturally from his own principles, were due to the
influence of Leukippos.<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c014'><sup>[530]</sup></a> This, however, is not necessarily
the case. We know that Alkmaion (<a href='#sec96'>§ 96</a>) spoke
of “pores” in connexion with sensation, and it may
equally well be from him that Empedokles got the
theory. It may be added that this is more in
accordance with the history of certain other physiological
views which are common to Alkmaion and
the later Ionian philosophers. We can generally see
that those reached Ionia through the medical school
which Empedokles founded.<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c014'><sup>[531]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Death.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec103'></a>103. We are told that Empedokles leapt into the
crater of Etna that he might be deemed a god. This
appears to be a malicious version<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c014'><sup>[532]</sup></a> of a tale set on foot
by his adherents that he had been snatched up to
heaven in the night.<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c014'><sup>[533]</sup></a> Both stories would easily get
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>accepted; for there was no local tradition. Empedokles
did not die in Sicily, but in the Peloponnese, or,
perhaps, at Thourioi. He had gone to Olympia to
have his religious poem recited to the Hellenes; his
enemies were able to prevent his return, and he was
seen in Sicily no more.<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c014'><sup>[534]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Writings.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec104'></a>104. Empedokles was the second philosopher to
expound his system in verse, if we leave the satirist
Xenophanes out of account. He was also the last
among the Greeks; for the forged Pythagorean poems
may be neglected.<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c014'><sup>[535]</sup></a> Lucretius imitates Empedokles
in this, just as Empedokles imitated Parmenides. Of
course, the poetical imagery creates a difficulty for the
interpreter; but it would be wrong to make too much
of it. It cannot be said that it is harder to extract
the philosophical kernel from the verses of Empedokles
than from the prose of Herakleitos.</p>

<p class='c002'>There is some divergence of opinion as to the
poetical merit of Empedokles. The panegyric of
Lucretius is well known.<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c014'><sup>[536]</sup></a> Aristotle says in one place
that Empedokles and Homer have nothing in common
but the metre; in another, that Empedokles was “most
Homeric.”<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c014'><sup>[537]</sup></a> To my mind, there can be no question
that he was a genuine poet, far more so than Parmenides.
No one doubts nowadays that Lucretius was one, and
Empedokles really resembles him very closely.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The remains.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span><a id='sec105'></a>105. We have more abundant remains of Empedokles
than of any other early Greek philosopher.
If we may trust our manuscripts of Diogenes and of
Souidas, the librarians of Alexandria estimated the <cite>Poem
on Nature</cite> and the <cite>Purifications</cite> together as 5000 verses,
of which about 2000 belonged to the former work.<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c014'><sup>[538]</sup></a>
Diels gives about 350 verses and parts of verses from
the cosmological poem, or not a fifth of the whole. It
is important to remember that, even in this favourable
instance, so much has been lost. Besides the two
poems, the Alexandrian scholars possessed a prose work
of 600 lines on medicine ascribed to Empedokles.
The tragedies and other poems which were sometimes
attributed to him seem really to belong to a younger
writer of the same name, who is said by Souidas to
have been his grandson.<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c014'><sup>[539]</sup></a></p>

and to become many once more when the one is parted    <span class='linenum'>10</span>
asunder, so far they come into being and their life abides not.
But, inasmuch as they never cease changing their places
continually, so far they are ever immovable as they go round
the circle of existence.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>But come, hearken to my words, for it is learning that
increaseth wisdom. As I said before, when I declared the <span class='linenum'>15</span>
heads of my discourse, I shall tell thee a twofold tale. At
one time it grew together to be one only out of many, at
another it parted asunder so as to be many instead of one;—Fire
and Water and Earth and the mighty height of
Air; dread Strife, too, apart from these, of equal weight to
each, and Love among them, equal in length and breadth. <span class='linenum'>20</span>
Her do thou contemplate with thy mind, nor sit with dazed
eyes. It is she that is known as being implanted in the frame
of mortals. It is she that makes them have thoughts of love
and work the works of peace. They call her by the names of
Joy and Aphrodite. Her has no mortal yet marked moving      <span class='linenum'>25</span>
round among them,<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c014'><sup>[547]</sup></a> but do thou attend to the undeceitful
ordering of my discourse.</p>

<p class='c002'>For all these are equal and alike in age, yet each has a
different prerogative and its own peculiar nature. And nothing  <span class='linenum'>30</span>
comes into being besides these, nor do they pass away; for,
if they had been passing away continually, they would not be
now, and what could increase this All and whence could it
come? How, too, could it perish, since no place is empty of
these things? They are what they are; but, running through
one another, they become now this, now that,<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c014'><sup>[548]</sup></a> and like things <span class='linenum'>35</span>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>This (the contest of Love and Strife) is manifest in the
mass of mortal limbs. At one time all the limbs that are the
body’s portion are brought together by Love in blooming life’s
high season; at another, severed by cruel Strife, they wander <span class='linenum'>5</span>
each alone by the breakers of life’s sea. It is the same with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>plants and the fish that make their homes in the waters, with
the beasts that have their lairs on the hills and the seabirds
that sail on wings. R. P. 173 d.</p>

<p class='c002'>Come now, look at the things that bear witness to my
earlier discourse, if so be that there was any shortcoming as
to their form in the earlier list. Behold the sun, everywhere
bright and warm, and all the immortal things that are bathed in
heat and bright radiance.<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c014'><sup>[549]</sup></a> Behold the rain, everywhere dark   <span class='linenum'>5</span>
and cold; and from the earth issue forth things close-pressed
and solid. When they are in strife all these are different
in form and separated; but they come together in love,
and are desired by one another.</p>

<p class='c002'>For out of these have sprung all things that were and are
and shall be—trees and men and women, beasts and birds   <span class='linenum'>10</span>
and the fishes that dwell in the waters, yea, and the gods that
live long lives and are exalted in honour. R. P. 166 i.</p>

<p class='c002'>For these things are what they are; but, running through
one another, they take different shapes—so much does mixture

    <div><a id='Em.22'></a>(22)</div>
  </div>

<p class='c002'>For all of these—sun, earth, sky, and sea—are at one with
all their parts that are cast far and wide from them in mortal
things. And even so all things that are more adapted for
mixture are like to one another and united in love by
Aphrodite. Those things, again, that differ most in origin,   <span class='linenum'>5</span>
mixture and the forms imprinted on each, are most hostile,
being altogether unaccustomed to unite and very sorry by
the bidding of Strife, since it hath wrought their birth.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>all things come together so as to be one only; not all at once, <span class='linenum'>5</span>
but coming together at their will each from different quarters;
and, as they mingled, countless tribes of mortal creatures were
scattered abroad. Yet many things remained unmixed, alternating
with the things that were being mixed, namely, all that
Strife not fallen yet retained; for it had not yet altogether retired <span class='linenum'>10</span>
perfectly from them to the outermost boundaries of the circle.
Some of it still remained within, and some had passed out from
the limbs of the All. But in proportion as it kept rushing
out, a soft, immortal stream of blameless Love kept running
in, and straightway those things became mortal which had
been immortal before, those things were mixed that had been <span class='linenum'>15</span>
unmixed, each changing its path. And, as they mingled,
countless tribes of mortal creatures were scattered abroad
endowed with all manner of forms, a wonder to behold.

<div class='sidenote'>Empedokles and Parmenides.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec106'></a>106. At the very outset of his poem, Empedokles
is careful to mark the difference between himself and
previous inquirers. He speaks angrily of those who,
though their experience was only partial, professed to
have found the whole (fr. <a href='#Em.2'>2</a>); he even calls this
“madness” (fr. <a href='#Em.4'>4</a>). No doubt he is thinking of
Parmenides. His own position is not, however,
sceptical. He only deprecates the attempt to construct
a theory of the universe off-hand instead of trying to
understand each thing we come across “in the way in
which it is clear” (fr. <a href='#Em.4'>4</a>). And this means that we
must not, like Parmenides, reject the assistance of the
senses. Weak though they are (fr. <a href='#Em.2'>2</a>), they are the
only channels through which knowledge can enter our
minds at all. We soon discover, however, that
Empedokles is not very mindful of his own warnings.
He too sets up a system which is to explain everything,
though that system is no longer a monistic one.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is often said that this system was an attempt to
mediate between Parmenides and Herakleitos. It is
not easy, however, to find any trace of specially
Herakleitean doctrine in it, and it would be truer to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>say that it aimed at mediating between Eleaticism
and the senses. He repeats, almost in the same words,
the Eleatic argument for the sole reality and indestructibility
of “what <em>is</em>” (frs. <a href='#Em.11'>11-15</a>); and his idea of
the “Sphere” seems to be derived from the Parmenidean
description of the universe as it truly is.<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c014'><sup>[579]</sup></a> Parmenides
had held that the reality which underlies the illusory
world presented to us by the senses was a corporeal,
spherical, continuous, eternal, and immovable <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenum</i></span>,
and it is from this that Empedokles starts. Given the
sphere of Parmenides, he seems to have said, How are
we to get from it to the world we know? How are
we to introduce motion into the immovable <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenum</i></span>?
Now Parmenides need not have denied the possibility
of motion within the Sphere, though he was
bound to deny all motion of the Sphere itself; but
such an admission on his part, had he made it, would
not have served to explain anything. If any part of
the Sphere were to move, the room of the displaced
matter must at once be taken by other matter, for
there is no empty space. This, however, would be of
precisely the same kind as the matter it had displaced;
for all “that <em>is</em>” is one. The result of the motion
would be precisely the same as that of rest; it could
account for no change. But, Empedokles must have
asked, is this assumption of perfect homogeneity in
the Sphere really necessary? Evidently not; it is
simply the old unreasoned feeling that existence must
be one. If, instead of this, we were to assume a
number of existent things, it would be quite possible
to apply all that Parmenides says of reality to each of
them, and the forms of existence we know might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>explained by the mingling and separation of those
realities. The conception of “elements” (στοιχεῖα), to
use a later term,<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c014'><sup>[580]</sup></a> was found, and the required formula
follows at once. So far as concerns particular things,
it is true, as our senses tell us, that they come into
being and pass away; but, if we have regard to the
ultimate elements of which they are composed, we
shall say with Parmenides that “what <em>is</em>” is uncreated
and indestructible (fr. <a href='#Pa.17'>17</a>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The “four roots.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec107'></a>107. The “four roots” of all things (fr. <a href='#Em.6'>6</a>) which
Empedokles assumed were those that have become
traditional—Fire, Air, Earth, and Water. It is to be
noticed, however, that he does not call Air ἀήρ, but
αἰθήρ, and this must be because he wished to avoid
any confusion with what had hitherto been meant by
the former word. He had, in fact, made the great
discovery that atmospheric air is a distinct corporeal
substance, and is not to be identified with empty space
on the one hand or rarefied mist on the other. Water
is not liquid air, but something quite different.<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c014'><sup>[581]</sup></a> This
truth Empedokles demonstrated by means of the
apparatus known as the <em>klepsydra</em>, and we still possess
the verses in which he applied his discovery to the
explanation of respiration and the motion of the blood
(fr. <a href='#Em.100'>100</a>). Aristotle laughs at those who try to show
there is no empty space by shutting up air in water-clocks
and torturing wineskins. They only prove, he
says, that air is a thing.<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c014'><sup>[582]</sup></a> That, however, is exactly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>what Empedokles intended to prove, and it was one
of the most important discoveries in the early history
of science. It will be convenient for us to translate
the αἰθήρ of Empedokles by “air”; but we must be
careful in that case not to render the word ἀήρ in the
same way. Anaxagoras seems to have been the first
to use it of atmospheric air.</p>

<p class='c002'>Empedokles also called the “four roots” by the
names of certain divinities—“shining Zeus, life-bringing
Hera, Aidoneus, and Nestis” (fr. <a href='#Em.6'>6</a>)—though there is
some doubt as to how these names are to be apportioned
among the elements. Nestis is said to have
been a Sicilian water-goddess, and the description of
her shows that she stands for Water; but there is a
conflict of opinion as to the other three. This, however,
need not detain us.<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c014'><sup>[583]</sup></a> We are already prepared
to find that Empedokles called the elements gods; for
all the early thinkers had spoken in this way of
whatever they regarded as the primary substance.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>We must only remember that the word is not used in
its religious sense. Empedokles did not pray or
sacrifice to the elements, and the use of divine names
is in the main an accident of the poetical form in
which he cast his system.</p>

<p class='c002'>Empedokles regarded the “roots of all things” as
eternal. Nothing can come from nothing or pass
away into nothing (fr. <a href='#Em.12'>12</a>); what is <em>is</em>, and there is no
room for coming into being and passing away (fr. <a href='#Em.8'>8</a>).
Further, Aristotle tells us, he taught that they were
unchangeable.<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c014'><sup>[584]</sup></a> This Empedokles expressed by saying
that “they are what they are” (frs. <a href='#Em.17'>17</a>, <a href='#Em.34'>34</a>; <a href='#Em.21'>21</a>, <a href='#Em.13'>13</a>),
and are “always alike.” Again, they are all “equal,”
a statement which seemed strange to Aristotle,<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c014'><sup>[585]</sup></a> but
was quite intelligible in the days of Empedokles.
Above all, the elements are ultimate. All other bodies,
as Aristotle puts it, might be divided till you came
to the elements; but Empedokles could give no
further account of these without saying (as he did not)
that there is an element of which Fire and the rest
are in turn composed.<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c014'><sup>[586]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The “four roots” are given as an exhaustive
enumeration of the elements (fr. <a href='#Em.23'>23</a> <i>sub fin.</i>); for they
account for all the qualities presented by the world to
the senses. When we find, as we do, that the school
of medicine which regarded Empedokles as its founder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>identified the four elements with the “opposites,” the
hot and the cold, the moist and the dry, which formed
the theoretical foundation of its system, we see at once
how the theory is related to previous views of reality.<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c014'><sup>[587]</sup></a>
To put it shortly, what Empedokles did was to take
the opposites of Anaximander and to declare that
they were “things,” each of which was real in the
Parmenidean sense. We must remember that the
conception of quality had not yet been formed.
Anaximander had no doubt regarded his “opposites”
as things; though, before the time of Parmenides, no
one had fully realised how much was implied in saying
that anything is a thing. That is the stage we have
now reached. There is still no conception of quality,
but there is a clear apprehension of what is involved
in saying that a thing <em>is</em>.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle twice<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c014'><sup>[588]</sup></a> makes the statement that, though
Empedokles assumes four elements, he treats them as
two, opposing Fire to all the rest. This, he says, we
can see for ourselves from his poem. So far as the
general theory of the elements goes, it is impossible to
see anything of the sort; but, when we come to the
origin of the world (<a href='#sec112'>§ 112</a>), we shall find that Fire
certainly plays a leading part, and this may be what
Aristotle meant. It is also true that in the biology
(<a href='#sec114'>§ 114</a>–<a href='#sec116'>116</a>) Fire fulfils a unique function, while the
other three act more or less in the same way. But we
must remember that it has no pre-eminence over the
rest: all are equal.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Strife and Love.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec108'></a>108. The Eleatic criticism had made it necessary for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>subsequent thinkers to explain motion.<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c014'><sup>[589]</sup></a> Empedokles
starts, as we have seen, from an original state of the
“four roots,” which only differs from the Sphere of
Parmenides in so far as it is a mixture, not a homogeneous
and continuous mass. The fact that it is a
mixture makes change and motion possible; but, were
there nothing outside the Sphere which could enter
in, like the Pythagorean “Air,” to separate the four
elements, nothing could ever arise from it. Empedokles
accordingly assumed the existence of such a substance,
and he gave it the name of Strife. But the effect of
this would be to separate all the elements in the
Sphere completely, and then nothing more could
possibly happen; something else was needed to bring
the elements together again. This Empedokles found
in Love, which he regarded as the same impulse to
union that is implanted in human bodies (fr. <a href='#Em.17'>17</a>, <a href='#Em.22'>22</a>
sqq.). He looks at it, in fact, from a purely
physiological point of view, as was natural for the
founder of a medical school. No mortal had yet
marked, he says, that the very same Love which
men know in their bodies had a place among the
elements.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is important to observe that the Love and Strife
of Empedokles are no incorporeal forces, but corporeal
elements like the other four. At the time, this was
inevitable; nothing incorporeal had yet been dreamt of.
Naturally, Aristotle is puzzled by this characteristic of
what he regarded as efficient causes. “The Love
of Empedokles,” he says<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c014'><sup>[590]</sup></a> “is both an efficient cause,
for it brings things together, and a material cause, for
it is a part of the mixture.” And Theophrastos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>expressed the same idea by saying<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c014'><sup>[591]</sup></a> that Empedokles
sometimes gave an efficient power to Love and Strife,
and sometimes put them on a level with the other
four. The verses of Empedokles himself leave no
room for doubt that the two were thought of as spatial
and corporeal. All the six are called “equal.” Love
is said to be “equal in length and breadth” to the
others, and Strife is described as equal to each of them
in weight (fr. <a href='#Em.17'>17</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>The function of Love is to produce union; that of
Strife, to break it up again. Aristotle, however, rightly
points out that in another sense it is Love that divides
and Strife that unites. When the Sphere is broken up
by Strife, the result is that all the Fire, for instance,
which was contained in it comes together and becomes
one; and again, when the elements are brought
together once more by Love, the mass of each is
divided. In another place, he says that, while Strife is
assumed as the cause of destruction, and does, in fact,
destroy the Sphere, it really gives birth to everything
else in so doing.<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c014'><sup>[592]</sup></a> It follows that we must carefully
distinguish between the Love of Empedokles and
that “attraction of like for like” to which he also
attributed an important part in the formation of the
world. The latter is not an element distinct from the
others; it depends, we shall see, on the proper nature
of each element, and is only able to take effect when
Strife divides the Sphere. Love, on the contrary, is
something that comes from outside and produces an
attraction of <em>unlikes</em>.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Mixture and separation.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span><a id='sec109'></a>109. But, when Strife has once separated the
elements, what is it that determines the direction of
their motion? Empedokles seems to have given no
further explanation than that each was “running”
in a certain direction (fr. <a href='#Em.53'>53</a>). Plato severely condemns
this in the <cite>Laws</cite>,<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c014'><sup>[593]</sup></a> on the ground that no room
is thus left for design. Aristotle also blames him for
giving no account of the Chance to which he ascribed
so much importance. Nor is the Necessity, of which
he also spoke, further explained.<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c014'><sup>[594]</sup></a> Strife enters into
the Sphere at a certain time in virtue of Necessity, or
“the mighty oath” (fr. <a href='#Em.30'>30</a>); but we are left in the dark
as to the origin of this.</p>

<p class='c002'>The expression used by Empedokles to describe the
movement of the elements is that they “run through
each other” (fr. <a href='#Em.17'>17</a>, <a href='#Em.34'>34</a>). Aristotle tells us<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c014'><sup>[595]</sup></a> that he
explained mixture in general by “the symmetry of
pores.” And this is the true explanation of the
“attraction of like for like.” The “pores” of like
bodies are, of course, much the same size, and these
bodies can therefore mingle easily. On the other hand,
a finer body will “run through” a coarse one without
becoming mixed, and a coarse body will not be able
to enter into the pores of a finer one at all. It will be
observed that, as Aristotle says, this really implies
something like the atomic theory; but there is no
evidence that Empedokles himself was conscious of
that. Another question raised by Aristotle is even
more instructive. Are the pores, he asks, empty or
full? If empty, what becomes of the denial of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>void? If full, why need we assume pores at all?<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c014'><sup>[596]</sup></a>
These questions Empedokles would have found it hard
to answer. They point to a real want of thoroughness
in his system, and mark it as a mere stage in the
transition from Monism to Atomism.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The four periods.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec110'></a>110. It will be clear from all this that we must
distinguish four periods in the cycle. First we have
the Sphere, in which all the elements are mixed
together by Love. Secondly, there is the period when
Love is passing out and Strife coming in, when,
therefore, the elements are partially separated and
partially combined. Thirdly, comes the complete
separation of the elements, when Love is outside the
world, and Strife has given free play to the attraction of
like for like. Lastly, we have the period when Love is
bringing the elements together again, and Strife is
passing out. This brings us back in time to the
Sphere, and the cycle begins afresh. Now a world
such as ours can exist only in the second and fourth of
these periods; and it is clear that, if we are to
understand Empedokles, we must discover in which of
these we now are. It seems to be generally supposed
that we are in the fourth period;<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c014'><sup>[597]</sup></a> I hope to show that
we are really in the second, that when Strife is gaining
the upper hand.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Our world the work of Strife.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec111'></a>111. That a world of perishable things arises both
in the second and fourth period is distinctly stated by
Empedokles (fr. <a href='#Em.17'>17</a>), and it is inconceivable that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>himself had not made up his mind which of these
worlds is ours. Aristotle is clearly of opinion that it is
the world which arises when Strife is increasing. In
one place, he says that Empedokles “holds that the
world is in a similar condition now in the period of
Strife as formerly in that of Love.”<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c014'><sup>[598]</sup></a> In another, he
tell us that Empedokles omits the generation of things
in the period of Love, just because it is unnatural to
represent this world, in which the elements are separate,
as arising from things in a state of separation.<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c014'><sup>[599]</sup></a> This
remark can only mean that the scientific theories contained
in the poem of Empedokles assumed the increase
of Strife, or, in other words, that they represented the
course of evolution as the disintegration of the Sphere,
not as the gradual coming together of things from a
state of separation.<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c014'><sup>[600]</sup></a> That is only what we should
expect, if we are right in supposing that the problem
he set himself to solve was the origin of this world from
the Sphere of Parmenides, and it is also in harmony
with the universal tendency of such speculations to
represent the world as getting worse rather than better.
We have only to consider, then, whether the details of
the system bear out this general view.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Formation of the world by Strife.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec112'></a>112. To begin with the Sphere, in which the “four
roots of all things” are mixed together, we note in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>first place that it is called a god in the fragments just
as the elements are, and that Aristotle more than once
refers to it in the same way.<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c014'><sup>[601]</sup></a> We must remember
that Love itself is a part of this mixture,<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c014'><sup>[602]</sup></a> while Strife
surrounds or encompasses it on every side just as the
Boundless encompasses the world in earlier systems.
Strife, however, is not boundless, but equal in bulk to
each of the four roots and to Love.</p>

<p class='c002'>At the appointed time, Strife begins to enter into
the Sphere and Love to go out of it (frs. 30, 31).
The fragments by themselves throw little light on this;
but Aetios and the Plutarchean <cite>Stromateis</cite> have between
them preserved a very fair tradition of what Theophrastos
said on the point.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Empedokles held that Air was first separated out and
secondly Fire. Next came Earth, from which, highly compressed
as it was by the impetus of its revolution, Water
gushed forth. From the water Mist was produced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>evaporation. The heavens were formed out of the Air and
the sun out of the Fire, while terrestrial things were condensed
from the other elements. Aet. ii. 6. 3 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 334; R. P.
170).</p>

<p class='c002'>Empedokles held that the Air when separated off from the
original mixture of the elements was spread round in a circle.
After the Air, Fire running outwards, and not finding any
other place, ran up under the solid that surrounded the Air.<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c014'><sup>[603]</sup></a>
There were two hemispheres revolving round the earth, the
one altogether composed of fire, the other of a mixture of air
and a little fire. The latter he supposed to be the Night.
The origin of their motion he derived from the fact of fire
preponderating in one hemisphere owing to its accumulation
there. Ps.-Plut. <cite>Strom.</cite> fr. 10 (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 582; R. P. 170 a).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>The first of the elements to be separated out by
Strife, then, was Air, which took the outermost position
surrounding the world (cf. fr. <a href='#Em.38'>38</a>). We must not, however,
take the statement that it surrounded the world
“in a circle” too strictly. It appears that Empedokles
regarded the heavens as shaped like an egg.<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c014'><sup>[604]</sup></a> Here,
probably, we have a trace of Orphic ideas. At any
rate, the outer circle of the Air became solidified or
frozen, and we thus get a crystalline vault as the
boundary of the world. We note that it was Fire
which solidified the Air and turned it to ice. Fire in
general had a solidifying power.<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c014'><sup>[605]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>In its upward rush Fire displaced a portion of the
Air in the upper half of the concave sphere formed by
the frozen sky. This air then sunk downwards,
carrying with it a small portion of the fire. In this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>way, two hemispheres were produced: one, consisting
entirely of fire, the diurnal hemisphere; the other, the
nocturnal, consisting of air with a little fire.</p>

<p class='c002'>The accumulation of Fire in the upper hemisphere
disturbs the equilibrium of the heavens and causes them
to revolve; and this revolution not only produces the
alternation of day and night, but by its rapidity keeps
the heavens and the earth in their places. This was
illustrated, Aristotle tells us, by the simile of a cup of
water whirled round at the end of a string.<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c014'><sup>[606]</sup></a> The
verses which contained this remarkable account of so-called
“centrifugal force” have been lost; but the experimental
illustration is in the manner of Empedokles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The sun, moon, stars, and earth.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec113'></a>113. It will be observed that day and night have
been explained without reference to the sun. Day is
produced by the light of the fiery diurnal hemisphere,
while night is the shadow thrown by the earth when
the fiery hemisphere is on the other side of it (fr. <a href='#Em.48'>48</a>).
What, then, is the sun? The Plutarchean <cite>Stromateis</cite><a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c014'><sup>[607]</sup></a>
again give us the answer: “The sun is not fire in
substance, but a reflexion of fire like that which comes
from water.” Plutarch himself makes one of his
personages say: “You laugh at Empedokles for saying
that the sun is a product of the earth, arising from the
reflexion of the light of heaven, and once more ‘flashes
back to Olympos with untroubled countenance.’”<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c014'><sup>[608]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Aetios says:<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c014'><sup>[609]</sup></a> “Empedokles held that there were two
suns: one, the archetype, the fire in one hemisphere
of the world, filling the whole hemisphere always
stationed opposite its own reflexion; the other, the
visible sun, its reflexion in the other hemisphere, that
which is filled with air mingled with fire, produced by the
reflexion of the earth, which is round, on the crystalline
sun, and carried round by the motion of the fiery
hemisphere. Or, to sum it up shortly, the sun is a
reflexion of the terrestrial fire.”</p>

<p class='c002'>These passages, and especially the last, are by no
means clear. The reflexion which we call the sun
cannot be in the hemisphere opposite to the fiery one;
for that is the nocturnal hemisphere. We must say
rather that the light of the fiery hemisphere is reflected
by the earth on to the fiery hemisphere itself in one
concentrated flash. From this it follows that the
appearance which we call the sun is the same size as
the earth. We may explain the origin of this view as
follows. It had just been discovered that the moon
shone by reflected light, and there is always a tendency
to give any novel theory a wider application than it
really admits of. In the early part of the fifth century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, men saw reflected light everywhere; the Pythagoreans
held a very similar view, and when we come to
them, we shall see why Aetios, or rather his source,
expresses it by speaking of “two suns.”</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>It was probably in this connexion that Empedokles
announced that light takes some time to travel, though
its speed is so great as to escape our perception.<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c014'><sup>[610]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>“The moon,” we are told, “was composed of air
cut off by the fire; it was frozen just like hail, and
had its light from the sun.” It is, in other words, a
disc of frozen air, of the same substance as the solid
sky which surrounds the heavens. Diogenes says that
Empedokles taught it was smaller than the sun, and
Aetios tells us it was only half as distant from the
earth.<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c014'><sup>[611]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Empedokles did not attempt to explain the fixed
stars by reflected light, nor even the planets. They
were fiery, made out of the fire which the air carried
with it when forced beneath the earth by the upward
rush of fire at the first separation, as we saw above.
The fixed stars were attached to the frozen air; the
planets moved freely.<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c014'><sup>[612]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Empedokles was acquainted (fr. <a href='#Em.42'>42</a>) with the true
theory of solar eclipses, which, along with that of the
moon’s light, was the great discovery of this period.
He also knew (fr. <a href='#Em.48'>48</a>) that night is the conical shadow
of the earth, and not a sort of exhalation.</p>

<p class='c002'>Wind was explained from the opposite motions of
the fiery and airy hemispheres. Rain was caused by
the compression of the Air, which forced any water
there might be in it out of its pores in the form of
drops. Lightning was fire forced out from the clouds
in much the same way.<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c014'><sup>[613]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>The earth was at first mixed with water, but the
increasing compression caused by the velocity of the
world’s revolution made the water gush forth, so that
the sea is called “the sweat of the earth,” a phrase to
which Aristotle objects as a mere poetical metaphor.
The saltness of the sea was explained by the help of
this analogy.<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c014'><sup>[614]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Organic combinations.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec114'></a>114. Empedokles went on to show how the four
elements, mingled in different proportions, gave rise
to perishable things, such as bones, flesh, and the like.
These, of course, are the work of Love; but this in no
way contradicts the view taken above as to the period
of evolution to which this world belongs. Love is by
no means banished from the world yet, though one
day it will be. At present, it is still able to form
combinations of elements; but, just because Strife is
ever increasing, they are all perishable.</p>

<p class='c002'>The possibility of organic combinations depends
upon the fact that there is still water in the earth, and
even fire (fr. <a href='#Em.52'>52</a>). The warm springs of Sicily were a
proof of this, not to speak of Etna. These springs
Empedokles appears to have explained by one of his
characteristic images, drawn this time from the heating
of warm baths.<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c014'><sup>[615]</sup></a> It will be noted that his similes
are nearly all drawn from human inventions and
manufactures.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Plants.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec115'></a>115. Plants and animals were formed from the
four elements under the influence of Love and Strife.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>The fragments which deal with trees and plants
are 77-81; and these, taken along with certain
Aristotelian statements and the doxographical tradition,
enable us to make out pretty fully what the theory
was. The text of Aetios is very corrupt here; but it
may, perhaps, be rendered as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Empedokles says that trees were the first living creatures
to grow up out of the earth, before the sun was spread out,
and before day and night were distinguished; that, from the
symmetry of their mixture, they contain the proportion of
male and female; that they grow, rising up owing to the heat
which is in the earth, so that they are parts of the earth just
as embryos are parts of the uterus; that fruits are excretions
of the water and fire in plants, and that those which have a
deficiency of moisture shed their leaves when that is evaporated
by the summer heat, while those which have more moisture
remain evergreen, as in the case of the laurel, the olive, and
the palm; that the differences in taste are due to variations
in the particles contained in the earth and to the plants
drawing different particles from it, as in the case of vines;
for it is not the difference of the vines that makes wine good,
but that of the soil which nourishes them. Aet. v. 26, 4
(R. P. 172).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle finds fault with Empedokles for explaining
the double growth of plants, upwards and downwards,
by the opposite natural motions of the earth and fire
contained in them.<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c014'><sup>[616]</sup></a> For “natural motions” we must,
of course, substitute the attraction of like for like
(<a href='#sec109'>§ 109</a>). Theophrastos says much the same thing.<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c014'><sup>[617]</sup></a>
The growth of plants, then, is to be regarded as an
incident in that separation of the elements which
Strife is bringing about. Some of the fire which is
still beneath the earth (fr. <a href='#Em.52'>52</a>) meeting in its upward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>course with earth, still moist with water and “running”
down so as to “reach its own kind,” unites with it,
under the influence of the Love still left in the world,
to form a temporary combination, which we call a tree
or a plant.</p>

<p class='c002'>At the beginning of the pseudo-Aristotelian <cite>Treatise
on Plants</cite>,<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c014'><sup>[618]</sup></a> we are told that Empedokles attributed
desire, sensation, and the capacity for pleasure and
pain to plants, and he rightly saw that the two sexes
are combined in them. This is mentioned by Aetios,
and discussed in the pseudo-Aristotelian treatise. If
we may so far trust that Byzantine translation from a
Latin version of the Arabic,<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c014'><sup>[619]</sup></a> we get a most valuable
hint as to the reason. Plants, we are there told, came
into being “in an imperfect state of the world,”<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c014'><sup>[620]</sup></a> in
fact, at a time when Strife had not so far prevailed as
to differentiate the sexes. We shall see that the same
thing applies to the original race of animals in this
world. It is strange that Empedokles never observed
the actual process of generation in plants, but confined
himself to the statement that they spontaneously “bore
eggs” (fr. <a href='#Em.79'>79</a>), that is to say, fruit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Evolution of animals.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec116'></a>116. The fragments which deal with the evolution
of animals (57-62) must be understood in the light
of the statement (fr. <a href='#Em.17'>17</a>) that there is a double coming
into being and a double passing away of mortal things.
Empedokles describes two processes of evolution,
which take exactly opposite courses, one of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>belonging to the period of Love and the other to that
of Strife. The four stages of this double evolution
are accurately distinguished in a passage of Aetios,<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c014'><sup>[621]</sup></a> and
we shall see that there is evidence for referring two of
them to the second period of the world’s history and
two to the fourth.</p>

<p class='c002'>The first stage is that in which the various parts of
animals arise separately. It is that of heads without
necks, arms without shoulders, and eyes without foreheads
(fr. <a href='#Em.57'>57</a>). It is clear that this must be the first
stage in what we have called the fourth period of the
world’s history, that in which Love is coming in and
Strife passing out. Aristotle distinctly refers it to the
period of Love, by which, as we have seen, he means
the period when Love is increasing.<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c014'><sup>[622]</sup></a> It is in
accordance with this that he also says these scattered
members were subsequently put together by Love.<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c014'><sup>[623]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The second stage is that in which the scattered
limbs are united. At first, they were combined in all
possible ways (fr. <a href='#Em.59'>59</a>). There were oxen with human
heads, creatures with double faces and double breasts,
and all manner of monsters (fr. <a href='#Em.61'>61</a>). Those of them
that were fitted to survive did so, while the rest
perished. That is how the evolution of animals took
place in the period of Love.<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c014'><sup>[624]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>The third stage belongs to the period when the
unity of the Sphere is being destroyed by Strife. It is,
therefore, the first stage in the evolution of our present
world. It begins with “whole-natured forms” in which
there is not as yet any distinction of sex or species.<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c014'><sup>[625]</sup></a>
They are composed of earth and water, and are
produced by the upward motion of fire which is seeking
to reach its like.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the fourth stage, the sexes and species have
been separated, and new animals no longer arise from
the elements, but are produced by generation. We
shall see presently how Empedokles conceived this
to operate.</p>

<p class='c002'>In both these processes of evolution, Empedokles
was guided by the idea of the survival of the fittest.
Aristotle severely criticises this. “We may suppose,”
he says, “that all things have fallen out accidentally just
as they would have done if they had been produced for
some end. Certain things have been preserved because
they had spontaneously acquired a fitting structure,
while those which were not so put together have
perished and are perishing, as Empedokles says of the
oxen with human faces.”<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c014'><sup>[626]</sup></a> This, according to Aristotle,
leaves too much to chance. One curious instance has
been preserved. Vertebration was explained by saying
that an early invertebrate animal tried to turn round
and broke its back in so doing. This was a favourable
variation and so survived.<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c014'><sup>[627]</sup></a> It should be noted that it
clearly belongs to the period of Strife, and not, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the oxen with human heads, to that of Love. The
survival of the fittest was the law of both processes of
evolution.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec117'></a>117. The distinction of the sexes was an important
result of the gradual differentiation brought about by
the entrance of Strife into the world. Empedokles
differed from the theory given by Parmenides in his
Second Part (<a href='#sec95'>§ 95</a>) in holding that the warm element
preponderated in the male sex, and that males were
conceived in the warmer part of the uterus (fr. <a href='#Em.65'>65</a>).
The fœtus was formed partly from the male and partly
from the female semen (fr. <a href='#Em.63'>63</a>); and it was just the fact
that the substance of a new being’s body was divided
between the male and the female that produced desire
when the two were brought together by sight (fr. <a href='#Em.64'>64</a>). A
certain symmetry of the pores in the male and female
semen is, of course, necessary for procreation, and from
its absence Empedokles explained the sterility of mules.
The children most resemble that parent who contributed
most to their formation. The influence of statues and
pictures was also noted, however, as modifying the
appearance of the offspring. Twins and triplets were
due to a superabundance and division of the semen.<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c014'><sup>[628]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>As to the growth of the fœtus in the uterus, Empedokles
held that it was enveloped in a membrane,
and that its formation began on the thirty-sixth day
and was completed on the forty-ninth. The heart was
formed first, the nails and such things last. Respiration
did not begin till the time of birth, when the fluids
round the fœtus were withdrawn. Birth took place
in the ninth or seventh month, because the day had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>been originally nine months long, and afterwards
seven. Milk arises on the tenth day of the eighth
month (fr. <a href='#Em.68'>68</a>).<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c014'><sup>[629]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Death was the final separation by Strife of the fire
and earth in the body, each of which had all along
been striving to “reach its own kind.” Sleep was a
temporary separation to a certain extent of the fiery
element.<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c014'><sup>[630]</sup></a> At death the animal is resolved into its
elements, which perhaps enter into fresh combinations,
perhaps become permanently united with “their own
kind.” There can be no question here of an immortal
soul.</p>

<p class='c002'>Even in life, we may see the attraction of like to
like operating in animals just as it did in the upward
and downward growth of plants. Hair is the same
thing as foliage (fr. <a href='#Em.82'>82</a>); and, generally speaking, the
fiery part of animals tends upwards and the earthy
part downwards, though there are exceptions, as may
be seen in the case of certain shell-fish (fr. <a href='#Em.76'>76</a>), where
the earthy part is above. These exceptions are only
possible because there is still a great deal of Love
in the world. We also see the attraction of like for
like in the different habits of the various species of
animals. Those that have most fire in them fly up
into the air; those in which earth preponderates take
to the earth, as did the dog which always sat upon a
tile.<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c014'><sup>[631]</sup></a> Aquatic animals are those in which water predominates.
This does not, however, apply to fishes,
which are very fiery, and take to the water to cool
themselves.<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c014'><sup>[632]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Empedokles paid great attention to the subject of
respiration, and his very ingenious explanation of it has
been preserved in a continuous form (fr. <a href='#Em.100'>100</a>). We
breathe, he held, through all the pores of the skin, not
merely through the organs of respiration. The cause
of the alternate inspiration and expiration of the breath
was the movement of the blood from the heart to
the surface of the body and back again, which was
explained by the <em>klepsydra</em>.</p>

<p class='c002'>The nutrition and growth of animals is, of course,
to be explained from the attraction of like to like.
Each part of the body has pores into which the appropriate
food will fit. Pleasure and pain were derived
from the absence or presence of like elements, that is, of
nourishment which would fit the pores. Tears and
sweat arose from a disturbance which curdled the blood;
they were, so to say, the whey of the blood.<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c014'><sup>[633]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Perception.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec118'></a>118. For the theory of perception held by Empedokles
we have the original words of Theophrastos:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Empedokles speaks in the same way of all the senses, and
says that perception is due to the “effluences” fitting into
the passages of each sense. And that is why one cannot
judge the objects of another; for the passages of some of
them are too wide and those of others too narrow for the
sensible object, so that the latter either goes through without
touching or cannot enter at all. R. P. 177 b.</p>

<p class='c002'>He tries, too, to explain the nature of sight. He says that
the interior of the eye consists of fire, while round about it is
earth and air,<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c014'><sup>[634]</sup></a> through which its rarity enables the fire to
pass like the light in lanterns (fr. <a href='#Em.84'>84</a>). The passages of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>fire and water are arranged alternately; through those of the
fire we perceive light objects, through those of the water,
dark; each class of objects fits into each class of passages,
and the colours are carried to the sight by effluence.
R. P. <i>ib.</i></p>

<p class='c002'>But eyes are not all composed in the same way; some are
composed of like elements and some of opposite; some have
the fire in the centre and some on the outside. That is why
some animals are keen-sighted by day and others by night.
Those which have less fire are keen-sighted in the daytime,
for the fire within is brought up to an equality by that
without; those which have less of the opposite (<i>i.e.</i> water), by
night, for then their deficiency is supplemented. But, in
the opposite case, each will behave in the opposite manner.
Those eyes in which fire predominates will be dazzled in the
daytime, since the fire being still further increased will stop
up and occupy the pores of the water. Those in which water
predominates will, he says, suffer the same at night, for the
fire will be obstructed by the water. And this goes on till
the water is separated off by the air, for in each case it is
the opposite which is a remedy. The best tempered and
the most excellent vision is one composed of both in
equal proportions. This is practically what he says about
sight.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hearing, he holds, is produced by sound outside, when
the air moved by the voice sounds inside the ear; for the
sense of hearing is a sort of bell sounding inside the ear,
which he calls a “fleshy sprout.” When the air is set in
motion it strikes upon the solid parts and produces a sound.<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c014'><sup>[635]</sup></a>
Smell, he holds, arises from respiration, and that is why those
smell most keenly whose breath has the most violent motion,
and why most smell comes from subtle and light bodies.<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c014'><sup>[636]</sup></a> As
to touch and taste, he does not lay down how nor by means
of what they arise, except that he gives us an explanation
applicable to all, that sensation is produced by adaptation to
the pores. Pleasure is produced by what is like in its
elements and their mixture; pain, by what is opposite.
R. P. <i>ib.</i></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>And he gives a precisely similar account of thought and
ignorance. Thought arises from what is like and ignorance
from what is unlike, thus implying that thought is the same,
or nearly the same, as perception. For after enumerating
how we know each thing by means of itself, he adds, “for all
things are fashioned and fitted together out of these, and it
is by these men think and feel pleasure and pain” (fr. <a href='#Em.107'>107</a>).
And for this reason we think chiefly with our blood, for in
it of all parts of the body all the elements are most completely
mingled. R. P. 178.</p>

<p class='c002'>All, then, in whom the mixture is equal or nearly so, and
in whom the elements are neither at too great intervals nor
too small or too large, are the wisest and have the most exact
perceptions; and those who come next to them are wise in
proportion. Those who are in the opposite condition are the
most foolish. Those whose elements are separated by intervals
and rare are dull and laborious; those in whom they are
closely packed and broken into minute particles are impulsive,
they attempt many things and finish few because of the
rapidity with which their blood moves. Those who have a
well-proportioned mixture in some one part of their bodies
will be clever in that respect. That is why some are good
orators and some good artificers. The latter have a good
mixture in their hands, and the former in their tongues, and
so with all other special capacities. R. P. <i>ib.</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>Perception, then, is due to the meeting of an element
in us with the same element outside. This takes place
when the pores of the organ of sense are neither too
large nor too small for the “effluences” which all
things are constantly giving off (fr. <a href='#Em.89'>89</a>). Smell was
explained by respiration. The breath drew in along
with it the small particles which fit into the pores.
From Aetios<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c014'><sup>[637]</sup></a> we learn that Empedokles proved this
by the example of people with a cold in their head,
who cannot smell, just because they have a difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>in breathing. We also see from fr. <a href='#Em.101'>101</a> that the
scent of dogs was referred to in support of the theory.
Empedokles seems to have given no detailed account
of smell, and did not refer to touch at all.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c014'><sup>[638]</sup></a> Hearing
was explained by the motion of the air which struck
upon the cartilage inside the ear and made it swing
and sound like a bell.<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c014'><sup>[639]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The theory of vision<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c014'><sup>[640]</sup></a> is more complicated; and,
as Plato adopted most of it, it is of great importance
in the history of philosophy. The eye was conceived,
as by Alkmaion (<a href='#sec96'>§ 96</a>),<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c014'><sup>[641]</sup></a> to be composed of fire and
water. Just as in a lantern the flame is protected
from the wind by horn (fr. <a href='#Em.84'>84</a>), so the fire in the iris
is protected from the water which surrounds it in the
pupil by membranes with very fine pores, so that,
while the fire can pass out, the water cannot get in.
Sight is produced by the fire inside the eye going forth
to meet the object. This seems strange to us, because
we are accustomed to the idea of images being
impressed upon the retina. But <em>looking</em> at a thing
no doubt seemed much more like an action proceeding
from the eye than a mere passive state.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was quite aware, too, that “effluences,” as he
called them, came from things to the eyes as well;
for he defined colours as “effluences from forms (or
‘things’) fitting into the pores and perceived.”<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c014'><sup>[642]</sup></a> It is
not quite clear how these two accounts of vision were
reconciled, or how far we are entitled to credit
Empedokles with the Platonic theory. The statements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>which have been quoted seem to imply something very
like it.<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c014'><sup>[643]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Theophrastos tells us that Empedokles made no
distinction between thought and perception, a remark
already made by Aristotle.<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c014'><sup>[644]</sup></a> The chief seat of perception
was the blood, in which the four elements are
most evenly mixed, and especially the blood near the
heart (fr. <a href='#Em.105'>105</a>).<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c014'><sup>[645]</sup></a> This does not, however, exclude the
idea that other parts of the body may perceive also;
indeed, Empedokles held that all things have their
share of thought (fr. <a href='#Em.103'>103</a>). But the blood was specially
sensitive because of its finer mixture.<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c014'><sup>[646]</sup></a> From this it
naturally follows that Empedokles adopted the view,
already maintained in the Second Part of the poem of
Parmenides (fr. <a href='#Em.16'>16</a>), that our knowledge varies with
the varying constitution of our bodies (fr. <a href='#Em.106'>106</a>). This
consideration became very important later on as one
of the foundations of scepticism; but Empedokles
himself only drew from it the conclusion that we must
make the best use we can of our senses, and check one
by the other (fr. <a href='#Em.4'>4</a>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theology and religion.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec119'></a>119. The theoretical theology of Empedokles
reminds us of Xenophanes, his practical religious
teaching of Pythagoras and the Orphics. We are told
in the earlier part of the poem that certain “gods” are
composed of the elements; and that therefore though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>they “live long lives” they must pass away (fr. <a href='#Em.21'>21</a>).
We have seen that the elements and the Sphere are also
called gods, but that is in quite another sense of the word.</p>

<p class='c002'>If we turn to the religious teaching of the
<cite>Purifications</cite>, we find that everything turns on the
doctrine of transmigration. On the general significance
of this enough has been said above (<a href='#sec42'>§ 42</a>); the details
given by Empedokles are peculiar. According to a
decree of Necessity, “daemons” who have sinned are
forced to wander from their home in heaven for three
times ten thousand seasons (fr. <a href='#Em.115'>115</a>). He himself is
such an exiled divinity, and has fallen from his high
estate because he put his trust in raving Strife. The
four elements toss him from one to the other with
loathing; and so he has not only been a human being
and a plant, but even a fish. The only way to purify
oneself from the taint of original sin was by the cultivation
of ceremonial holiness, by purifications, and
abstinence from animal flesh. For the animals are our
kinsmen (fr. <a href='#Em.137'>137</a>), and it is parricide to lay hands on
them. In all this there are, no doubt, certain points of
contact with the cosmology. We have the “mighty
oath” (fr. <a href='#Em.115'>115</a>; cf. fr. <a href='#Em.30'>30</a>), the four elements, Hate as
the source of original sin, and Kypris as queen in the
Golden Age (fr. <a href='#Em.128'>128</a>). But these points are neither
fundamental nor of great importance. And it cannot
be denied that there are really contradictions between
the two poems. That, however, is just what we should
expect to find. All through this period, there seems
to have been a gulf between men’s religious beliefs, if
they had any, and their cosmological views. The few
points of contact which we have mentioned may have
been sufficient to hide this from Empedokles himself.</p>

(R. P. 162) that, according to Aristotle and Herakleides, Empedokles died
at the age of sixty. It is to be observed, however, that the words ἔτι δ’
Ἡρακλείδης are Sturz’s conjecture, the MSS. having ἔτι δ’ Ἡράκλειτον, and
Diogenes certainly said (ix. 3) that Herakleitos lived sixty years. On the
other hand, if the statement of Aristotle comes from the Περὶ ποιητῶν, it is
not obvious why he should mention Herakleitos at all; and Herakleides was

was a little older than Antiphon (<i>b.</i> Ol. LXX.), so it is clear we must go

with a narrow neck (αὐλός) at the top and with a sort of strainer (ἠθμός)
pierced with holes (τρήματα, τρυπήματα) at the bottom. The passage in

Any one can produce this effect with a water-bottle. If it were not for

Anaxagoras by name in this passage; but he speaks in the plural, and we

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f583'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r583'>583</a>. In antiquity the Homeric Allegorists made Hera Earth and Aidoneus
Air, a view which has found its way into Aetios from Poseidonios. It
arose as follows. The Homeric Allegorists were not interested in the
science of Empedokles, and did not see that his αἰθήρ was quite a different
thing from Homer’s ἀήρ. Now this is the dark element, and night is a
form of it, so it would naturally be identified with Aidoneus. Again,
Empedokles calls Hera φερέσβιος, and that is an old epithet of Earth in
Homer. Another view current in antiquity identified Hera with Air,
which is the theory of Plato’s <cite>Cratylus</cite>, and Aidoneus with Earth. The
Homeric Allegorists further identified Zeus with Fire, a view to which they
were doubtless led by the use of the word αἰθήρ. Now αἰθήρ certainly
means Fire in Anaxagoras, as we shall see, but there is no doubt that in
Empedokles it meant Air. It seems likely, then, that Knatz is right
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Empedoclea”</span> in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Schedae Philologicae Hermanno Usenero oblatae</cite></span>, 1891, pp.
1 sqq.) in holding that the bright Air of Empedokles was Zeus. This leaves
Aidoneus to stand for Fire; and nothing could have been more natural for
a Sicilian poet, with the volcanoes and hot springs of his native island in
mind, than this identification. He refers to the fires that burn beneath
the Earth himself (fr. <a href='#Em.52'>52</a>). If that is so, we shall have to agree with the
Homeric Allegorists that Hera is Earth; and there is certainly no
improbability in that.</p>

His difficulty is with the fragments, and if it can be shown that these can

settled. Aristotle was specially interested in Empedokles, and was not

<div class='footnote' id='f600'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r600'>600</a>. It need not mean that Empedokles said nothing about the world of
Love at all; for he obviously says something of both worlds in fr. <a href='#Em.17'>17</a>. It is
enough to suppose that, having described both in general terms, he went
on to treat the world of Strife in detail.</p>

(R. P. 166 i). Cf. Simpl. <cite>Phys.</cite> p. 1124, 1 (R. P. 167 b). In other places
Aristotle speaks of it as “the One.” Cf. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Gen. Corr.</cite></span> Α, 1. 315 a 7 (R. P.
168 e); <cite>Met.</cite> Β, 4. 1000 a 29 (R. P. 166 i); Α, 4. 985 a 28 (R. P. <i>ib.</i>).
This, however, involves a slight Aristotelian “development.” It is not
quite the same thing to say, as Empedokles does, that all things come together
“into one,” and to say that they come together “into the One.”
The latter expression suggests that they lose their distinct and proper
character in the Sphere, and thus become something like Aristotle’s own
“matter.” As has been pointed out (p. 265, <a href='#f586'><ins class='correction' title='n. 3'><i>n.</i> 586</ins></a>), it is hard for Aristotle
to grasp the conception of irreducible elements; but there can be no doubt
that in the Sphere, as in their separation, the elements remain “what they
are” for Empedokles. As Aristotle also knows quite well, the Sphere is a
mixture. Compare the difficulties about the “One” of Anaximander
discussed in Chap. I. <a href='#sec15'>§ 15</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f602'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r602'>602</a>. This accounts for Aristotle’s statement, which he makes once positively
(<cite>Met.</cite> Β, 1. 996 a 7) and once very doubtfully (<cite>Met.</cite> Γ, 4. 1001 a 12), that
Love was the substratum of the One in just the same sense as the Fire of
Herakleitos, the Air of Anaximenes, or the Water of Thales. He thinks
that all the elements become merged in Love, and so lose their identity.
In this case, it is in Love he recognises his own “matter.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI <br /> ANAXAGORAS OF KLAZOMENAI</h2>
</div>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Date.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec120'></a>120. All that Apollodoros tells us with regard to the
date of Anaxagoras seems to rest upon the authority
of Demetrios Phalereus, who said of him, in the
<cite>Register of Archons</cite>, that he began to study philosophy,
at the age of twenty, in the archonship of Kallias or
Kalliades at Athens (480-79 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c014'><sup>[647]</sup></a> This date was
probably derived from a calculation based upon the
philosopher’s age at the time of his trial, which
Demetrios had every opportunity of learning from
sources no longer extant. Apollodoros inferred that
Anaxagoras was born in Ol. LXX. (500-496 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),
and he adds that he died at the age of seventy-two in
Ol. LXXXVIII. 1 (428-27 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c014'><sup>[648]</sup></a> He doubtless thought
it natural that he should not survive Perikles, and still
more natural that he should die the year Plato was
born.<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c014'><sup>[649]</sup></a> We have a further statement, of doubtful
origin, but probably due to Demetrios also, that
Anaxagoras lived at Athens for thirty years. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>may be a genuine tradition;<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c014'><sup>[650]</sup></a> and if so, we get
from about 462 to 432 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> as the time he lived
there.</p>

<p class='c002'>There can be no doubt that these dates are very
nearly right. Aristotle tells us<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c014'><sup>[651]</sup></a> that Anaxagoras was
older than Empedokles, who was born about 490 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
(<a href='#sec98'>§ 98</a>); and Theophrastos said<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c014'><sup>[652]</sup></a> that Empedokles was
born “not long after Anaxagoras.” Demokritos, too,
said that he himself was a young man in the old age
of Anaxagoras, and he must have been born about
460 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c014'><sup>[653]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Early life.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec121'></a>121. Anaxagoras was born at Klazomenai, and
Theophrastos tells us that his father’s name was
Hegesiboulos.<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c014'><sup>[654]</sup></a> The names of both father and son
have an aristocratic sound, and we may assume they
belonged to a family which had won distinction in the
State. Nor need we reject the tradition that
Anaxagoras neglected his possessions to follow
science.<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c014'><sup>[655]</sup></a> It is certain, at any rate, that in the fourth
century he was already regarded as the type of the
man who leads the “theoretic life.”<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c014'><sup>[656]</sup></a> Of course the story
of his contempt for worldly goods was seized on later
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>by the historical novelist and tricked out with the
usual apophthegms. These do not concern us here.</p>

<p class='c002'>One incident belonging to the early manhood of
Anaxagoras is recorded, namely, his observation of the
huge meteoric stone which fell into the Aigospotamos
in 468-67 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c014'><sup>[657]</sup></a> Our authorities tell us that he predicted
this phenomenon, which is plainly absurd. But we
shall see reason to believe that it may have occasioned
one of his most striking departures from the earlier
cosmology, and led to his adoption of the very view
for which he was condemned at Athens. At all events,
the fall of the stone made a profound impression at the
time, and it was still shown to tourists in the days of
Pliny and Plutarch.<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c014'><sup>[658]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Relation to the Ionic school.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec122'></a>122. The doxographers speak of Anaxagoras as
the pupil of Anaximenes.<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c014'><sup>[659]</sup></a> This is, of course, out of
the question; Anaximenes most probably died before
Anaxagoras was born. But it is not enough to say
that the statement arose from the fact that the name of
Anaxagoras followed that of Anaximenes in the
<cite>Successions</cite>. That is true, no doubt; but it is not the
whole truth. We have its original source in a fragment
of Theophrastos himself, which states that Anaxagoras
had been “an associate of the philosophy of Anaximenes.”<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c014'><sup>[660]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Now this expression has a very distinct
meaning if we accept the view as to “schools” of
science set forth in the Introduction (§ XIV.). It means
that the old Ionic school survived the destruction of
Miletos in 494 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and continued to flourish in
the other cities of Asia. It means, further, that it
produced no man of distinction after its third great representative,
and that “the philosophy of Anaximenes”
was still taught by whoever was now at the head of
the society.</p>

<p class='c002'>At this point, it may be well to indicate briefly the
conclusions to which we shall come in the next few
chapters with regard to the development of philosophy
during the first half of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> We shall
find that, while the old Ionic school was still capable
of training great men, it was now powerless to keep
them. Anaxagoras went his own way; Melissos
and Leukippos, though they still retained enough of
the old views to bear witness to the source of their
inspiration, were too strongly influenced by the Eleatic
dialectic to remain content with the theories of Anaximenes.
It was left to second-rate minds like
Diogenes to champion the orthodox system, while
third-rate minds like Hippon of Samos even went
back to the cruder theory of Thales. The details of
this anticipatory sketch will become clearer as we go
on; for the present, it is only necessary to call the
reader’s attention to the fact that the old Ionic Philosophy
now forms a sort of background to our story,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>just as Orphic and Pythagorean religious ideas have
done in the preceding chapters.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Anaxagoras at Athens.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec123'></a>123. Anaxagoras was the first philosopher to take
up his abode at Athens. We are not to suppose,
however, that he was attracted thither by anything in
the character of the Athenians. No doubt Athens
had now become the political centre of the Hellenic
world; but it had not yet produced a single scientific
man. On the contrary, the temper of the citizen body
was and remained hostile to free inquiry of any kind.
Sokrates, Anaxagoras, and Aristotle fell victims in
different degrees to the bigotry of the democracy,
though, of course, their offence was political rather
than religious. They were condemned not as heretics,
but as innovators in the <em>state</em> religion. Still, as a
recent historian observes, “Athens in its flourishing
period was far from being a place for free inquiry to
thrive unchecked.”<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c014'><sup>[661]</sup></a> It is this, no doubt, that has
been in the minds of those writers who have represented
philosophy as something un-Greek. It was in reality
thoroughly Greek, though it was thoroughly un-Athenian.</p>

<p class='c002'>It seems most reasonable to suppose that Perikles
himself brought Anaxagoras to Athens, just as he
brought everything else he could. Holm has shown
with much skill how the aim of that great statesman
was, so to say, to Ionise his fellow-citizens, to impart
to them something of the flexibility and openness of
mind which characterised their kinsmen across the
sea. It is possible that it was Aspasia of Miletos who
introduced the Ionian philosopher to the Periklean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>circle, of which he was henceforth a chief ornament. The
Athenians in derision gave him the nickname of Nous.<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c014'><sup>[662]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The close relation in which Anaxagoras stood to
Perikles is placed beyond the reach of doubt by the
testimony of Plato. In the <cite>Phaedrus</cite><a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c014'><sup>[663]</sup></a> he makes
Sokrates say: “For all arts that are great, there is
need of talk and discussion on the parts of natural
science that deal with things on high; for that seems
to be the source which inspires high-mindedness and
effectiveness in every direction. Perikles added this
very acquirement to his original gifts. He fell in, it
seems, with Anaxagoras, who was a scientific man;
and, satiating himself with the theory of things on high,
and having attained to a knowledge of the true nature
of intellect and folly, which were just what the discourses
of Anaxagoras were mainly about, he drew
from that source whatever was of a nature to further
him in the art of speech.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A more difficult question is the alleged relation of
Euripides to Anaxagoras. The oldest authority for
it is Alexander of Aitolia, poet and librarian, who
lived at the court of Ptolemy Philadelphos (<i>c.</i> 280 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).
He referred to Euripides as the “nursling of brave
Anaxagoras.”<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c014'><sup>[664]</sup></a> A great deal of ingenuity has been
expended in trying to find the system of Anaxagoras
in the choruses of Euripides; but, it must now be
admitted, without result.<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c014'><sup>[665]</sup></a> The famous fragment on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>the blessedness of the scientific life might just as well
refer to any other cosmologist as to Anaxagoras, and
indeed suggests more naturally a thinker of a more
primitive type.<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c014'><sup>[666]</sup></a> On the other hand, there is one
fragment which distinctly expounds the central thought
of Anaxagoras, and could hardly be referred to any
one else.<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c014'><sup>[667]</sup></a> We may conclude, then, that Euripides
knew the philosopher and his views, but it is not safe
to go further.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The trial.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec124'></a>124. Shortly before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian
War, the enemies of Perikles began a series of
attacks upon him through his friends.<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c014'><sup>[668]</sup></a> Pheidias was
the first to suffer, and Anaxagoras was the next. That
he was an object of special hatred to the religious
party need not surprise us, even though the charge
made against him does not suggest that he went out
of his way to hurt their susceptibilities. The details
of the trial are somewhat obscure, but we can make
out a few points. The first step taken was the introduction
of a psephism by Diopeithes—the same whom
Aristophanes laughs at in <cite>The Birds</cite><a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c014'><sup>[669]</sup></a>—enacting that an
impeachment should be brought against those who did
not practise religion, and taught theories about “the
things on high.”<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c014'><sup>[670]</sup></a> What happened at the actual trial
is very differently related. Our authorities give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>hopelessly conflicting accounts.<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c014'><sup>[671]</sup></a> It is no use attempting
to reconcile these; it is enough to insist upon what is
certain. Now we know from Plato what the accusation
was.<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c014'><sup>[672]</sup></a> It was that Anaxagoras taught the sun was a
red-hot stone, and the moon earth; and we shall see
that he certainly did hold these views (<a href='#sec133'>§ 133</a>). For
the rest, the most plausible account is that he was got
out of prison and sent away by Perikles.<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c014'><sup>[673]</sup></a> We know
that such things were possible at Athens.</p>

<p class='c002'>Driven from his adopted home, Anaxagoras
naturally went back to Ionia, where at least he would
be free to teach what he pleased. He settled at
Lampsakos, and we shall see reason to believe that he
founded a school there.<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c014'><sup>[674]</sup></a> Probably he did not live
long after his exile. The Lampsakenes erected an
altar to his memory in their market-place, dedicated to
Mind and Truth; and the anniversary of his death was
long kept as a holiday for school-children, it was said
at his own request.<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c014'><sup>[675]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Writings.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span><a id='sec125'></a>125. Diogenes includes Anaxagoras in his list of
philosophers who left only a single book, and he has
also preserved the accepted criticism of it, namely, that
it was written “in a lofty and agreeable style.”<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c014'><sup>[676]</sup></a>
There is no evidence of any weight to set against this
testimony, which comes ultimately from the librarians
of Alexandria.<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c014'><sup>[677]</sup></a> The story that Anaxagoras wrote a
treatise on perspective as applied to scene-painting is
most improbable;<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c014'><sup>[678]</sup></a> and the statement that he composed
a mathematical work dealing with the quadrature
of the circle is due to misunderstanding of an expression
in Plutarch.<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c014'><sup>[679]</sup></a> We learn from the passage in
the <cite>Apology</cite>, referred to above, that the works of
Anaxagoras could be bought at Athens for a single
drachma; and that the book was of some length may
be gathered from the way in which Plato goes on to
speak of it.<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c014'><sup>[680]</sup></a> In the sixth century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> Simplicius had
access to a copy, doubtless in the library of the
Academy;<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c014'><sup>[681]</sup></a> and it is to him we owe the preservation
of all our fragments, with one or two very doubtful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>exceptions. Unfortunately his quotations seem to be
confined to the First Book, that dealing with general
principles, so that we are left somewhat in the dark
with regard to the treatment of details. This is the
more unfortunate, as it was Anaxagoras who first gave
the true theory of the moon’s light and, therefore, the
true theory of eclipses.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fragments.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec126'></a>126. I give the fragments according to the text and
arrangement of Diels, who has made some of them
completely intelligible for the first time.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.1'></a>(1) All things were together infinite both in number and
in smallness; for the small too was infinite. And, when all
things were together, none of them could be distinguished for
their smallness. For air and aether prevailed over all things,
being both of them infinite; for amongst all things these are
the greatest both in quantity and size.<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c014'><sup>[682]</sup></a> R. P. 151.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.2'></a>(2) For air and aether are separated off from the mass
that surrounds the world, and the surrounding mass is infinite
in quantity. R. P. <i>ib.</i></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.3'></a>(3) Nor is there a least of what is small, but there is always
a smaller; for it cannot be that what is should cease to be by
being cut.<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c014'><sup>[683]</sup></a> But there is also always something greater than
what is great, and it is equal to the small in amount, and,
compared with itself, each thing is both great and small.
R. P. 159 a.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.4'></a>(4) And since these things are so, we must suppose that
there are contained many things and of all sorts in the things
that are uniting, seeds of all things, with all sorts of shapes
and colours and savours (R. P. <i>ib.</i>), and that men have been
formed in them, and the other animals that have life, and
that these men have inhabited cities and cultivated fields as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>with us; and that they have a sun and a moon and the rest as
with us; and that their earth brings forth for them many
things of all kinds of which they gather the best together
into their dwellings, and use them (R. P. 160 b). Thus
much have I said with regard to separating off, to show that
it will not be only with us that things are separated off, but
elsewhere too.</p>

<p class='c002'>But before they were separated off, when all things were
together, not even was any colour distinguishable; for the
mixture of all things prevented it—of the moist and the dry,
and the warm and the cold, and the light and the dark, and
of much earth that was in it, and of a multitude of innumerable
seeds in no way like each other. For none of the
other things either is like any other. And these things being
so, we must hold that all things are in the whole. R. P. 151.<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c014'><sup>[684]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.5'></a>(5) And those things having been thus decided, we must
know that all of them are neither more nor less; for it is not
possible for them to be more than all, and all are always equal.
R. P. 151.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.6'></a>(6) And since the portions of the great and of the small
are equal in amount, for this reason, too, all things will be in
everything; nor is it possible for them to be apart, but all
things have a portion of everything. Since it is impossible
for there to be a least thing, they cannot be separated, nor
come to be by themselves; but they must be now, just as they
were in the beginning, all together. And in all things many
things are contained, and an equal number both in the greater
and in the smaller of the things that are separated off.</p>

<p class='c002'>(7) ... So that we cannot know the number of the things
that are separated off, either in word or deed.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.8'></a>(8) The things that are in one world are not divided nor
cut off from one another with a hatchet, neither the warm
from the cold nor the cold from the warm. R. P. 155 e.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.9'></a>(9) ... as these things revolve and are separated out by
the force and swiftness. And the swiftness makes the force.
Their swiftness is not like the swiftness of any of the things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>that are now among men, but in every way many times as
swift.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.10'></a>(10) How can hair come from what is not hair, or flesh
from what is not flesh? R. P. 155 f, n. 1.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.11'></a>(11) In everything there is a portion of everything except
Nous, and there are some things in which there is Nous also.
R. P. 160 b.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.12'></a>(12) All other things partake in a portion of everything,
while Nous is infinite and self-ruled, and is mixed with
nothing, but is alone, itself by itself. For if it were not by
itself, but were mixed with anything else, it would partake in
all things if it were mixed with any; for in everything there is
a portion of everything, as has been said by me in what goes
before, and the things mixed with it would hinder it, so that it
would have power over nothing in the same way that it has
now being alone by itself. For it is the thinnest of all things
and the purest, and it has all knowledge about everything
and the greatest strength; and Nous has power over all things,
both greater and smaller, that have life. And Nous had
power over the whole revolution, so that it began to revolve in
the beginning. And it began to revolve first from a small
beginning; but the revolution now extends over a larger space,
and will extend over a larger still. And all the things that are
mingled together and separated off and distinguished are all
known by Nous. And Nous set in order all things that were
to be, and all things that were and are not now and that are,
and this revolution in which now revolve the stars and the sun
and the moon, and the air and the aether that are separated off.
And this revolution caused the separating off, and the rare is
separated off from the dense, the warm from the cold, the light
from the dark, and the dry from the moist. And there are many
portions in many things. But no thing is altogether separated
off nor distinguished from anything else except Nous. And all
Nous is alike, both the greater and the smaller; while nothing
else is like anything else, but each single thing is and was most
manifestly those things of which it has most in it R. P. 155.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.13'></a>(13) And when Nous began to move things, separating off
took place from all that was moved, and so far as Nous set in
motion all was separated. And as things were set in motion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>and separated, the revolution caused them to be separated
much more.</p>

<p class='c002'>(14) And Nous, which ever is, is certainly there, where
everything else is, in the surrounding mass, and in what has
been united with it and separated off from it.<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c014'><sup>[685]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.15'></a>(15) The dense and the moist and the cold and the dark
came together where the earth is now, while the rare and the
warm and the dry (and the bright) went out towards the
further part of the aether.<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c014'><sup>[686]</sup></a> R. P. 156.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.16'></a>(16) From these as they are separated off earth is solidified;
for from mists water is separated off, and from water earth.
From the earth stones are solidified by the cold, and these rush
outwards more than water. R. P. 156.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.17'></a>(17) The Hellenes follow a wrong usage in speaking of
coming into being and passing away; for nothing comes into
being or passes away, but there is mingling and separation of
things that are. So they would be right to call coming into
being mixture, and passing away separation. R. P. 150.</p>

<p class='c002'>(18) It is the sun that puts brightness into the moon.</p>

<p class='c002'>(19) We call rainbow the reflexion of the sun in the clouds.
Now it is a sign of storm; for the water that flows round the
cloud causes wind or pours down in rain.</p>

<p class='c002'>(20) With the rise of the Dogstar men begin the harvest;
with its setting they begin to till the fields. It is hidden
for forty days and nights.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='An.21'></a>(21) From the weakness of our senses we are not able to
judge the truth.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Anaxagoras and his predecessors.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec127'></a>127. The system of Anaxagoras, like that of
Empedokles, aimed at reconciling the Eleatic doctrine
that corporeal substance is unchangeable with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>existence of a world which everywhere presents the
appearance of coming into being and passing away.
The conclusions of Parmenides are frankly accepted and
restated. Nothing can be added to all things; for there
cannot be more than all, and all is always equal (fr. <a href='#An.5'>5</a>).
Nor can anything pass away. What men commonly
call coming into being and passing away is really
mixture and separation (fr. <a href='#An.17'>17</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>This last fragment reads almost like a prose paraphrase
of Empedokles (fr. <a href='#Em.9'>9</a>); and it is in every way
probable that Anaxagoras derived his theory of
mixture from his younger contemporary, whose poem
was most likely published before his own treatise.<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c014'><sup>[687]</sup></a> We
have seen how Empedokles sought to save the world
of appearance by maintaining that the opposites—hot
and cold, moist and dry—were <em>things</em>, each one of
which was real in the Parmenidean sense. Anaxagoras
regarded this as inadequate. Everything changes into
everything else,<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c014'><sup>[688]</sup></a> the things of which the world is made
are not “cut off with a hatchet” (fr. <a href='#An.8'>8</a>) in this way.
On the contrary, the true formula must be: <em>There is a
portion of everything in everything</em> (fr. <a href='#An.11'>11</a>).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>“Everything in everything.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec128'></a>128. A part of the argument by which Anaxagoras
sought to prove this point has been preserved in a
corrupt form by Aetios, and Diels has recovered some
of the original words from the scholiast on St. Gregory
Nazianzene. “We use a simple nourishment,” he said,
“when we eat the fruit of Demeter or drink water. But
how can hair be made of what is not hair, or flesh of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>what is not flesh?” (fr. <a href='#An.10'>10</a>).<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c014'><sup>[689]</sup></a> That is just the sort of
question the early Milesians must have asked, only the
physiological interest has now definitely replaced the
meteorological. We shall find a similar train of
reasoning in Diogenes of Apollonia (fr. 2).</p>

<p class='c002'>The statement that there is a portion of everything
in everything, is not to be understood as referring
simply to the original mixture of things before the
formation of the worlds (fr. <a href='#An.1'>1</a>). On the contrary, even
now “all things are together,” and everything, however
small and however great, has an equal number of
“portions” (fr. <a href='#An.6'>6</a>). A smaller particle of matter could
only contain a smaller number of portions, if one of
those portions ceased to be; but if anything <em>is</em>, in the
full Parmenidean sense, it is impossible that mere
division should make it cease to be (fr. <a href='#An.3'>3</a>). Matter is
infinitely divisible; for there is no least thing, any
more than there is a greatest. But however great or
small a body may be, it contains just the same number
of “portions,” that is, a portion of everything.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The portions.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec129'></a>129. What are these “things” of which everything
contains a portion? It once was usual to represent the
theory of Anaxagoras as if he had said that wheat, for
instance, contained small particles of flesh, blood, bones,
and the like; but we have just seen that matter is
infinitely divisible (fr. <a href='#An.3'>3</a>), and that there are as many
“portions” in the smallest particle as in the greatest
(fr. <a href='#An.6'>6</a>). This is fatal to the old view. If everything
were made up of minute particles of everything else,
we could certainly arrive at a point where everything
was “unmixed,” if only we carried division far enough.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>This difficulty can only be solved in one way.<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c014'><sup>[690]</sup></a> In
fr. <a href='#An.8'>8</a> the examples given of things which are not “cut
off from one another with a hatchet” are the hot and
the cold; and elsewhere (frs. <a href='#An.4'>4</a>, <a href='#An.15'>15</a>), mention is made of
the other traditional “opposites.” Aristotle says that, if
we suppose the first principles to be infinite, they may
either be one in kind, as with Demokritos, or opposite.<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c014'><sup>[691]</sup></a>
Simplicius, following Porphyry and Themistios, refers
the latter view to Anaxagoras;<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c014'><sup>[692]</sup></a> and Aristotle himself
implies that the opposites of Anaxagoras had as much
right to be called first principles as the “homoeomeries.”<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c014'><sup>[693]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It is of those opposites, then, and not of the different
forms of matter, that everything contains a portion.
Every particle, however large or however small,
contains every one of those opposite qualities. That
which is hot is also to a certain extent cold. Even
snow, Anaxagoras affirmed, was black;<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c014'><sup>[694]</sup></a> that is, even
the white contains a certain portion of the opposite
quality. It is enough to indicate the connexion of
this with the views of Herakleitos (<a href='#sec80'>§ 80</a>).<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c014'><sup>[695]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Seeds.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span><a id='sec130'></a>130. The difference, then, between the theory of
Anaxagoras and that of Empedokles is this. Empedokles
had taught that, if you divide the various things
which make up this world, and in particular the parts
of the body, such as flesh, bones, and the like, far
enough, you come to the four “roots” or elements,
which are, accordingly, the ultimate reality. Anaxagoras
held that, however far you may divide any of
these things—and they are infinitely divisible—you
never come to a part so small that it does not contain
portions of all the opposites. The smallest portion of
bone is still bone. On the other hand, everything can
pass into everything else just because the “seeds,” as
he called them, of each form of matter contain a
portion of everything, that is, of all the opposites, though
in different proportions. If we are to use the word
“element” at all, it is these seeds that are the elements
in the system of Anaxagoras.</p>

<p class='c002'>Aristotle expresses this by saying that Anaxagoras
regards the ὁμοιομερῆ as στοιχεῖα.<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c014'><sup>[696]</sup></a> We have seen
that the term στοιχεῖον is of later date than Anaxagoras,
and it is natural to suppose that the word ὁμοιομερῆ is
also only Aristotle’s name for the “seeds.” In his own
system, the ὁμοιομερῆ are intermediate between the
elements (στοιχεῖα), of which they are composed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>the organs (ὄργανα), which are composed of them.
The heart cannot be divided into hearts, but the parts
of flesh are flesh. That being so, Aristotle’s statement
is quite intelligible from his own point of view, but there
is no reason for supposing that Anaxagoras expressed
himself in that particular way. All we are entitled to
infer is that he said the “seeds,” which he had substituted
for the “roots” of Empedokles, were not the
opposites in a state of separation, but each contained a
portion of them all. If Anaxagoras had used the
term “homoeomeries”<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c014'><sup>[697]</sup></a> himself, it would be strange
that Simplicius should quote no fragment containing it.</p>

<p class='c002'>The difference between the two systems may also
be regarded from another point of view. Anaxagoras
was not obliged by his theory to regard the elements
of Empedokles as primary, a view to which there were
obvious objections, especially in the case of earth. He
explained them in quite another way. Though everything
has a portion of everything in it, things appear to
be that of which there is most in them (fr. <a href='#An.12'>12</a> <i>sub fin.</i>).
We may say, then, that Air is that in which there is most
cold, Fire that in which there is most heat, and so on,
without giving up the view that there is a portion of
cold in the fire and a portion of heat in the air.<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c014'><sup>[698]</sup></a> The
great masses which Empedokles had taken for elements
are really vast collections of all manner of “seeds.”
Each of them is, in fact, a πανσπερμία.<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c014'><sup>[699]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>“All things together.”</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span><a id='sec131'></a>131. From all this it follows that, when “all things
were together,” and when the different seeds of things
were mixed together in infinitely small particles (fr. <a href='#An.1'>1</a>),
the appearance presented would be that of one of what
had hitherto been regarded as the primary substances.
As a matter of fact, they did present the appearance
of “air and aether”; for the qualities (things) which
belong to these prevail in quantity over all other
things in the universe, and everything is most obviously
that of which it has most in it (fr. <a href='#An.12'>12</a> <i>sub fin.</i>). Here,
then, Anaxagoras attaches himself to Anaximenes.
The primary condition of things, before the formation
of the worlds, is much the same in both; only, with
Anaxagoras, the original mass is no longer the primary
substance, but a mixture of innumerable seeds divided
into infinitely small parts.</p>

<p class='c002'>This mass is infinite, like the air of Anaximenes,
and it supports itself, since there is nothing surrounding
it.<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c014'><sup>[700]</sup></a> Further, the “seeds” of all things which it
contains are infinite in number (fr. <a href='#An.1'>1</a>). But, as the
innumerable seeds may be divided into those in which
the portions of cold, moist, dense, and dark prevail, and
those which have most of the warm, dry, rare, and
light in them, we may say that the original mass was
a mixture of infinite Air and of infinite Fire. The
seeds of Air, of course, contain “portions” of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>“things” that predominate in Fire, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>; but
we regard everything as being that of which it has
most in it. Lastly, there is no void in this mixture,
an addition to the theory made necessary by the
arguments of Parmenides. It is, however, worthy of
note that Anaxagoras added an experimental proof of
this to the purely dialectical one of the Eleatics. He
used the <em>klepsydra</em> experiment as Empedokles had
done (fr. <a href='#Em.100'>100</a>), and also showed the corporeal nature of
air by means of inflated skins.<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c014'><sup>[701]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Nous.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec132'></a>132. Like Empedokles, Anaxagoras required some
external cause to produce motion in the mixture.
Body, Parmenides had shown, would never move
itself, as the Milesians had supposed. Anaxagoras
called the cause of motion by the name of Nous. It
was this which made Aristotle say that he “stood out
like a sober man from the random talkers that had
preceded him,”<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c014'><sup>[702]</sup></a> and he has often been credited with
the introduction of the spiritual into philosophy. The
disappointment expressed both by Plato and Aristotle
as to the way in which Anaxagoras worked out the
theory should, however, make us pause to reflect before
accepting too exalted a view of it. Plato<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c014'><sup>[703]</sup></a> makes
Sokrates say: “I once heard a man reading a book,
as he said, of Anaxagoras, and saying it was Mind
that ordered the world and was the cause of all things.
I was delighted to hear of this cause, and I thought he
really was right.... But my extravagant expectations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>were all dashed to the ground when I went on and
found that the man made no use of Mind at all. He
ascribed no causal power whatever to it in the ordering
of things, but to airs, and aethers, and waters, and a
host of other strange things.” Aristotle, probably
with this passage in mind, says:<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c014'><sup>[704]</sup></a> “Anaxagoras uses
Mind as a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>deus ex machina</i></span> to account for the formation
of the world; and whenever he is at a loss to explain
why anything necessarily is, he drags it in. But in
other cases he makes anything rather than Mind the
cause.” These utterances may well suggest that the
Nous of Anaxagoras did not really stand on a higher
level than the Love and Strife of Empedokles, and this
will only be confirmed when we look at what he
himself has to say about it.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the first place, Nous is unmixed (fr. <a href='#An.12'>12</a>), and
does not, like other things, contain a portion of everything.
This would hardly be worth saying of an
immaterial mind; no one would suppose that to be
hot or cold. The result of its being unmixed is that
it “has power over” everything, that is to say, in the
language of Anaxagoras, it causes things to move.<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c014'><sup>[705]</sup></a>
Herakleitos had said as much of Fire, and Empedokles
of Strife. Further, it is the “thinnest” of all things,
so that it can penetrate everywhere, and it would be
meaningless to say that the immaterial is “thinner”
than the material. It is true that Nous also “knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>all things”; but so, perhaps, did the Fire of
Herakleitos,<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c014'><sup>[706]</sup></a> and certainly the Air of Diogenes.<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c014'><sup>[707]</sup></a>
Zeller holds, indeed, that Anaxagoras meant to speak
of something incorporeal; but he admits that he did
not succeed in doing so,<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c014'><sup>[708]</sup></a> and that is historically the
important point. Nous is certainly imagined as
occupying space; for we hear of greater and smaller
parts of it (fr. <a href='#An.12'>12</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>The truth probably is that Anaxagoras substituted
Nous for the Love and Strife of Empedokles, because
he wished to retain the old Ionic doctrine of a
substance that “knows” all things, and to identify
this with the new theory of a substance that “moves”
all things. Perhaps, too, it was his increased interest in
physiological as distinguished from purely cosmological
matters that led him to speak of Mind rather than
Soul. The former word certainly suggests design
more clearly than the latter. But, in any case, the
originality of Anaxagoras lies far more in the theory
of matter than in that of Nous.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Formation of the worlds.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec133'></a>133. The formation of a world starts with a
rotatory motion which Nous imparts to a portion of
the mixed mass in which “all things are together”
(fr. <a href='#An.13'>13</a>), and this rotatory motion gradually extends
over a wider and wider space. Its rapidity (fr. <a href='#An.9'>9</a>)
produced a separation of the rare and the dense, the
cold and the hot, the dark and the light, the moist and
the dry (fr. <a href='#An.15'>15</a>). This separation produces two great
masses, the one consisting of the rare, hot, light, and
dry, called the “Aether”; the other, in which the
opposite qualities predominate, called “Air” (fr. <a href='#An.1'>1</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>Of these the Aether or Fire<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c014'><sup>[709]</sup></a> took the outside while
the Air occupied the centre (fr. <a href='#An.15'>15</a>).</p>

<p class='c002'>The next stage is the separation of the air into
clouds, water, earth, and stones (fr. <a href='#An.16'>16</a>). In this
Anaxagoras follows Anaximenes closely. In his
account of the origin of the heavenly bodies, however,
he showed himself more original. We read at the
end of fr. <a href='#An.16'>16</a> that stones “rush outwards more than
water,” and we learn from the doxographers that the
heavenly bodies were explained as stones torn from
the earth by the rapidity of its revolution and made
red-hot by the speed of their own motion.<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c014'><sup>[710]</sup></a> Perhaps
the fall of the meteoric stone at Aigospotamoi had
something to do with the origin of this theory. It
may also be observed that, while in the earlier stages
of the world-formation we are guided chiefly by the
analogy of water rotating with light and heavy bodies
floating in it, we are here reminded rather of a sling.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Innumerable worlds.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec134'></a>134. That Anaxagoras adopted the ordinary Ionian
theory of innumerable worlds is perfectly clear from
fr. <a href='#An.4'>4</a>, which we have no right to regard as other than
continuous.<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c014'><sup>[711]</sup></a> The words “that it was not only with
us that things were separated off, but elsewhere too”
can only mean that Nous has caused a rotatory
movement in more parts of the boundless mixture than
one. Aetios certainly includes Anaxagoras among
those who held there was only one world; but this
testimony cannot be considered of the same weight as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>that of the fragments.<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c014'><sup>[712]</sup></a> Zeller’s reference of the words
“elsewhere, as with us” to the moon is very improbable.
Is it likely that any one would say that
the inhabitants of the moon “have a sun and moon
as with us”?<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c014'><sup>[713]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec135'></a>135. The cosmology of Anaxagoras is clearly based
upon that of Anaximenes, as will be obvious from
a comparison of the following passage of Hippolytos<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c014'><sup>[714]</sup></a>
with the quotations given in Chap. I. (<a href='#sec29'>§ 29</a>):—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>(3) The earth is flat in shape, and remains suspended
because of its size and because there is no vacuum.<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c014'><sup>[715]</sup></a> For this
reason the air is very strong, and supports the earth which is
borne up by it.</p>

<p class='c002'>(4) Of the moisture on the surface of the earth, the sea
arose from the waters in the earth (for when these were
evaporated the remainder turned salt),<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c014'><sup>[716]</sup></a> and from the rivers
which flow into it.</p>

<p class='c002'>(5) Rivers take their being both from the rains and from the
waters in the earth; for the earth is hollow and has waters in
its cavities. And the Nile rises in summer owing to the water
that comes down from the snows in Ethiopia.<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c014'><sup>[717]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>(6) The sun and the moon and all the stars are fiery stones
carried round by the rotation of the aether. Under the stars
are the sun and moon, and also certain bodies which revolve
with them, but are invisible to us.</p>

<p class='c002'>(7) We do not feel the heat of the stars because of the
greatness of their distance from the earth; and, further, they
are not so warm as the sun, because they occupy a colder
region. The moon is below the sun, and nearer us.</p>

<p class='c002'>(8) The sun surpasses the Peloponnesos in size. The
moon has not a light of her own, but gets it from the sun.
The course of the stars goes under the earth.</p>

<p class='c002'>(9) The moon is eclipsed by the earth screening the sun’s
light from it, and sometimes, too, by the bodies below the moon
coming before it. The sun is eclipsed at the new moon, when
the moon screens it from us. Both the sun and the moon turn
in their courses owing to the repulsion of the air. The moon
turns frequently, because it cannot prevail over the cold.</p>

<p class='c002'>(10) Anaxagoras was the first to determine what concerns
the eclipses and the illumination of the sun and moon.
And he said the moon was of earth, and had plains and
ravines in it. The Milky Way was the reflexion of the
light of the stars that were not illuminated by the sun.
Shooting stars were sparks, as it were, which leapt out owing
to the motion of the heavenly vault.</p>

<p class='c002'>(11) Winds arose when the air was rarefied by the sun, and
when things were burned and made their way to the vault of
heaven and were carried off. Thunder and lightning were
produced by heat striking upon clouds.</p>

<p class='c002'>(12) Earthquakes were caused by the air above striking on
that beneath the earth; for the movement of the latter caused
the earth which floats on it to rock.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>All this confirms in the most striking way the statement
of Theophrastos, that Anaxagoras had belonged to
the school of Anaximenes. The flat earth floating on
the air, the dark bodies below the moon, the explanation
of the solstices and the “turnings” of the moon by the
resistance of air, the explanations given of wind and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>thunder and lightning, are all derived from the earlier
inquirer.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Biology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec136'></a>136. “There is a portion of everything in everything
except Nous, and there are some things in which
there is Nous also” (fr. <a href='#An.11'>11</a>). In these words Anaxagoras
laid down the distinction between animate and
inanimate things. He tells us that it is the same Nous
that “has power over,” that is, sets in motion, all things
that have life, both the greater and the smaller (fr. <a href='#An.12'>12</a>).
The Nous in living creatures is the same in all (fr. <a href='#An.12'>12</a>),
and from this it followed that the different grades of
intelligence which we observe in the animal and
vegetable worlds depend entirely on the structure of the
body. The Nous was the same, but it had more
opportunities in one body than another. Man was the
wisest of animals, not because he had a better sort of
Nous, but simply because he had hands.<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c014'><sup>[718]</sup></a> This view is
quite in accordance with the previous development of
thought upon the subject. Parmenides, in the Second
Part of his poem (fr. <a href='#Pa.16'>16</a>), had already made the thought
of men depend upon the constitution of their limbs.</p>

<p class='c002'>As all Nous is the same, we are not surprised to
find that plants were regarded as living creatures. If
we may trust the pseudo-Aristotelian <cite>Treatise on
Plants</cite><a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c014'><sup>[719]</sup></a> so far, Anaxagoras argued that they must feel
pleasure and pain in connexion with their growth and
with the fall of their leaves. Plutarch says<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c014'><sup>[720]</sup></a> that he
called plants “animals fixed in the earth.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Both plants and animals originated in the first
instance from the πανσπερμία. Plants first arose when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>the seeds of them which the air contained were brought
down by the rain-water,<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c014'><sup>[721]</sup></a> and animals originated in a
similar way.<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c014'><sup>[722]</sup></a> Like Anaximander, Anaxagoras held
that animals first arose in the moist element.<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c014'><sup>[723]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec137'></a>137. In these scanty notices we seem to see traces
of a polemical attitude towards Empedokles, and the
same may be observed in what we are told of the
theory of perception adopted by Anaxagoras, especially
in the view that perception is of contraries.<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c014'><sup>[724]</sup></a> The
account which Theophrastos gives of this<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c014'><sup>[725]</sup></a> is as
follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>But Anaxagoras says that perception is produced by
opposites; for like things cannot be affected by like. He
attempts to give a detailed enumeration of the particular
senses. We see by means of the image in the pupil; but no
image is cast upon what is of the same colour, but only on
what is different. With most living creatures things are of a
different colour to the pupil by day, though with some this is
so by night, and these are accordingly keen-sighted at that
time. Speaking generally, however, night is more of the same
colour with the eyes than day. And an image is cast on the
pupil by day, because light is a concomitant cause of the image,
and because the prevailing colour casts an image more readily
upon its opposite.<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c014'><sup>[726]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It is in the same way that touch and taste discern their
objects. That which is just as warm or just as cold as we are
neither warms us nor cools us by its contact; and, in the same
way, we do not apprehend the sweet and the sour by means of
themselves. We know cold by warm, fresh by salt, and sweet
by sour, in virtue of our deficiency in each; for all these are
in us to begin with. And we smell and hear in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>manner; the former by means of the accompanying respiration,
the latter by the sound penetrating to the brain, for the bone
which surrounds this is hollow, and it is upon it that the
sound falls.<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c014'><sup>[727]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>And all sensation implies pain, a view which would seem
to be the consequence of the first assumption, for all unlike
things produce pain by their contact. And this pain is made
perceptible by the long continuance or by the excess of a
sensation. Brilliant colours and excessive noises produce pain,
and we cannot dwell long on the same things. The larger
animals are the more sensitive, and, generally, sensation is
proportionate to the size of the organs of sense. Those animals
which have large, pure, and bright eyes, see large objects and
from a great distance, and contrariwise.<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c014'><sup>[728]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>And it is the same with hearing. Large animals can hear
great and distant sounds, while less sounds pass unperceived;
small animals perceive small sounds and those near at hand.<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c014'><sup>[729]</sup></a>
It is the same too with smell. Rarefied air has more smell;
for, when air is heated and rarefied, it smells. A large animal
when it breathes draws in the condensed air along with the
rarefied, while a small one draws in the rarefied by itself; so
the large one perceives more. For smell is better perceived
when it is near than when it is far by reason of its being more
condensed, while when dispersed it is weak. But, roughly
speaking, large animals do not perceive a rarefied smell, nor
small animals a condensed one.<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c014'><sup>[730]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>This theory marks in some respects an advance
upon that of Empedokles. It was a happy thought of
Anaxagoras to make sensation depend upon irritation
by opposites, and to connect it with pain. Many
modern theories are based upon a similar idea.</p>

<p class='c002'>That Anaxagoras regarded the senses as incapable
of reaching the truth of things is shown by the
fragments preserved by Sextus. But we must not, for
all that, turn him into a sceptic. The saying preserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>by Aristotle<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c014'><sup>[731]</sup></a> that “things are as we suppose them to
be,” has no value at all as evidence. It comes from
some collection of apophthegms, not from the treatise
of Anaxagoras himself; and it had, as likely as not, a
moral application. He did say (fr. <a href='#An.21'>21</a>) that “the
weakness of our senses prevents our discerning the
truth,” but this meant simply that we do not see the
“portions” of everything which are in everything; for
instance, the portions of black which are in the white.
Our senses simply show us the portions that prevail.
He also said that the things which are seen give us
the power of seeing the invisible, which is the very
opposite of scepticism (fr. <a href='#An.21a'>21<i>a</i></a>).</p>

<p class='c022'>Hermippos represents Anaxagoras as already in prison under sentence of
death when Perikles shamed the people into letting him off. Lastly,
Hieronymos says he never was condemned at all. Perikles brought him
into court thin and wasted by disease, and the judges acquitted him out of
compassion! The Medism alleged by Satyros no doubt comes from
Stesimbrotos, who made Anaxagoras the friend of Themistokles instead
of Perikles. This, too, explains the accuser’s name (Busolt, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gr. Gesch.</cite></span>

The familiar sentence quoted by Diog. ii. 6 (R. P. 153) is not a fragment

Theophrastos and the doxographers; but it is to be noted that Aetios,
supposing as he does that Anaxagoras himself used the term, gives it an
entirely wrong meaning. He says that the ὁμοιομέρειαι were so called from
the likeness of the particles of the τροφή to those of the body (<cite>Dox.</cite> 279 a
21; R. P. 155 f). Lucretius, i. 830 sqq. (R. P. 150 a) has a similar
account of the matter, derived from Epicurean sources. Obviously, it
cannot be reconciled with what Aristotle says.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f697'>

by Demokritos (Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de An.</cite></span> 404 a 8; R. P. 200), and it occurs in the
Περὶ διαίτης (<i>loc. cit.</i>). It seems natural to suppose that it was used by
Anaxagoras himself, as he used the term σπέρματα. Much difficulty has
been caused by the apparent inclusion of Water and Fire among the
ὁμοιομερῆ in Arist. <cite>Met.</cite> Α, 3. 984 a 11 (R. P. 150 a). Bonitz understands
the words καθάπερ ὕδωρ ἢ πῦρ to mean “as we have just seen that
Fire and Water do in the system of Empedokles.” In any case, καθάπερ
goes closely with οὕτω, and the general sense is that Anaxagoras applies
to the ὁμοιομερῆ what is really true of the στοιχεῖα. It would be better to
delete the comma after πῦρ and add one after φησι, for συγκρίσει καὶ διακρίσει
μόνον is explanatory of οὕτω ... καθάπερ. In the next sentence, I read
ἁπλῶς for ἄλλως with Zeller (<cite>Arch.</cite> ii. p. 261). See also Arist. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Caelo</cite></span>,

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII <br /> THE PYTHAGOREANS</h2>
</div>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The Pythagorean school.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec138'></a>138. We have seen (<a href='#sec40'>§ 40</a>) how the Pythagoreans,
after losing their supremacy at Kroton, concentrated
themselves at Rhegion; but the school founded there
was soon broken up. Archippos stayed behind in
Italy; but Philolaos and Lysis, the latter of whom
had escaped as a young man from the massacre of
Kroton, betook themselves to continental Hellas,
settling finally at Thebes. We know from Plato that
Philolaos was there some time during the latter part
of the fifth century, and Lysis was afterwards the
teacher of Epameinondas.<a id='r732' /><a href='#f732' class='c014'><sup>[732]</sup></a> Some of the Pythagoreans,
however, were able to return to Italy later on.
Philolaos certainly did so, and Plato implies that he
had left Thebes some time before 399 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, the year
in which Sokrates was put to death. In the fourth
century, the chief seat of the school is at Taras, and
we find the Pythagoreans heading the opposition to
Dionysios of Syracuse. It is to this period that
Archytas belongs. He was the friend of Plato, and
almost realised, if he did not suggest, the ideal of the
philosopher king. He ruled Taras for years, and Aristoxenos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>tells us that he was never defeated in the field
of battle.<a id='r733' /><a href='#f733' class='c014'><sup>[733]</sup></a> He was also the inventor of mathematical
mechanics. At the same time, Pythagoreanism had
taken root in Hellas. Lysis, we have seen, remained
at Thebes, where Simmias and Kebes had heard
Philolaos, and there was an important community of
Pythagoreans at Phleious. Aristoxenos was personally
acquainted with the last generation of the school,
and mentioned by name Xenophilos the Chalkidian
from Thrace, with Phanton, Echekrates, Diokles, and
Polymnestos of Phleious. They were all, he said,
disciples of Philolaos and Eurytos.<a id='r734' /><a href='#f734' class='c014'><sup>[734]</sup></a> Plato was on
friendly terms with these men, and dedicated the
<cite>Phaedo</cite> to them.<a id='r735' /><a href='#f735' class='c014'><sup>[735]</sup></a> Xenophilos was the teacher of
Aristoxenos, and lived in perfect health at Athens till
the age of a hundred and five.<a id='r736' /><a href='#f736' class='c014'><sup>[736]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Philolaos.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec139'></a>139. This generation of the school really belongs,
however, to a later period, and cannot be profitably
studied apart from Plato; it is with their master
Philolaos we have now to deal. The facts we know
about his teaching from external sources are few in
number. The doxographers, indeed, ascribe to him
an elaborate theory of the planetary system, but
Aristotle never mentions his name in connexion with
this. He gives it as the theory of “the Pythagoreans”
or of “some Pythagoreans.”<a id='r737' /><a href='#f737' class='c014'><sup>[737]</sup></a> It seems natural to
suppose, however, that the Pythagorean elements of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Plato’s <cite>Phaedo</cite> and <cite>Gorgias</cite> come mainly from
Philolaos. Plato makes Sokrates express surprise
that Simmias and Kebes had not learnt from him why
it is unlawful for a man to take his life,<a id='r738' /><a href='#f738' class='c014'><sup>[738]</sup></a> and it seems
to be implied that the Pythagoreans at Thebes used
the word “philosopher” in the special sense of a man
who is seeking to find a way of release from the burden
of this life.<a id='r739' /><a href='#f739' class='c014'><sup>[739]</sup></a> It is extremely probable that Philolaos
spoke of the body (σῶμα) as the tomb (σῆμα) of the
soul.<a id='r740' /><a href='#f740' class='c014'><sup>[740]</sup></a> In any case, we seem to be justified in holding
that he taught the old Pythagorean religious doctrine
in some form, and it is likely that he laid special stress
upon knowledge as a means of release. That is the
impression we get from Plato, and he is by far the
best authority we have on the subject.</p>

<p class='c002'>We know further that Philolaos wrote on
“numbers”; for Speusippos followed him in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>account he gave of the Pythagorean theories on that
subject.<a id='r741' /><a href='#f741' class='c014'><sup>[741]</sup></a> It is probable that he busied himself mainly
with arithmetic, and we can hardly doubt that his
geometry was of the primitive type described in an
earlier chapter. Eurytos was his disciple, and we have
seen (<a href='#sec47'>§ 47</a>) that his views were still very crude.</p>

<p class='c002'>We also know now that Philolaos wrote on
medicine,<a id='r742' /><a href='#f742' class='c014'><sup>[742]</sup></a> and that, while apparently influenced by
the theories of the Sicilian school, he opposed them
from the Pythagorean standpoint. In particular, he
said that our bodies were composed only of the warm,
and did not participate in the cold. It was only after
birth that the cold was introduced by respiration. The
connexion of this with the old Pythagorean theory is
obvious. Just as the Fire in the macrocosm draws in
and limits the cold dark breath which surrounds the
world (<a href='#sec53'>§ 53</a>), so do our bodies inhale cold breath from
outside. Philolaos made bile, blood, and phlegm the
causes of disease; and, in accordance with the theory
just mentioned, he had to deny that the phlegm was
cold, as the Sicilian school held it was. Its etymology
proved that it was warm. As Diels says, Philolaos
strikes us as an “uninteresting eclectic” so far as his
medical views are concerned.<a id='r743' /><a href='#f743' class='c014'><sup>[743]</sup></a> We shall see, however,
that it was just this preoccupation with the medicine
of the Sicilian school that gave rise to some of the
most striking developments of later Pythagoreanism.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Plato and the Pythagoreans.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec140'></a>140. Such, so far as we can see, was the historical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>Philolaos, and he is a sufficiently remarkable figure.
He is usually, however, represented in a different light,
and has even been spoken of as a “precursor of
Copernicus.” To understand this, we shall have to
consider for a little the story of what can only be
called a literary conspiracy. Not till this has been
exposed will it be possible to estimate the real
importance of Philolaos and his immediate disciples.</p>

<p class='c002'>As we can see from the <cite>Phaedo</cite> and the <cite>Gorgias</cite>,
Plato was intimate with these men and was deeply
impressed by their religious teaching, though it is plain
too that he did not adopt it as his own faith. He
was still more attracted by the scientific side of
Pythagoreanism, and to the last this exercised a great
influence on him. His own system in its final form
had many points of contact with it, as he is careful to
mark in the <cite>Philebus</cite>.<a id='r744' /><a href='#f744' class='c014'><sup>[744]</sup></a> But, just because he stood so
near it, he is apt to develop Pythagoreanism on lines
of his own, which may or may not have commended
themselves to Archytas, but are no guide to the views
of Philolaos and Eurytos. He is not careful, however,
to claim the authorship of his own improvements in
the system. He did not believe that cosmology could
be an exact science, and he is therefore quite willing
to credit Timaios the Lokrian, or “ancient sages”
generally, with theories which certainly had their birth
in the Academy.</p>

<p class='c002'>Now Plato had many enemies and detractors, and
this literary device enabled them to bring against him
the charge of plagiarism. Aristoxenos was one of
these enemies, and we know he made the extraordinary
statement that most of the <cite>Republic</cite> was to be found in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>a work by Protagoras.<a id='r745' /><a href='#f745' class='c014'><sup>[745]</sup></a> He seems also to be the
original source of the story that Plato bought “three
Pythagorean books” from Philolaos and copied the
<cite>Timaeus</cite> out of them. According to this, the “three
books” had come into the possession of Philolaos;
and, as he had fallen into great poverty, Dion was
able to buy them from him, or from his relatives, at
Plato’s request, for a hundred <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>minae</i></span>.<a id='r746' /><a href='#f746' class='c014'><sup>[746]</sup></a> It is certain,
at any rate, that this story was already current in the
third century; for the sillographer Timon of Phleious
addresses Plato thus: “And of thee too, Plato, did the
desire of discipleship lay hold. For many pieces of
silver thou didst get in exchange a small book, and
starting from it didst learn to write <cite>Timaeus</cite>.”<a id='r747' /><a href='#f747' class='c014'><sup>[747]</sup></a>
Hermippos, the pupil of Kallimachos, said that “some
writer” said that Plato himself bought the books from
the relatives of Philolaos for forty Alexandrian <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>minae</i></span>
and copied the <cite>Timaeus</cite> out of it; while Satyros, the
Aristarchean, says he got it through Dion for a
hundred <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>minae</i></span>.<a id='r748' /><a href='#f748' class='c014'><sup>[748]</sup></a> There is no suggestion in any of
these accounts that the book was by Philolaos himself;
they imply rather that what Plato bought was either a
book by Pythagoras, or at any rate authentic notes of
his teaching, which had come into the hands of
Philolaos. In later times, it was generally supposed
that the work entitled <cite>The Soul of the World</cite>, by
Timaios the Lokrian, was meant;<a id='r749' /><a href='#f749' class='c014'><sup>[749]</sup></a> but it has now
been proved beyond a doubt that this cannot have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>existed earlier than the first century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> We know
nothing of Timaios except what Plato tells us himself,
and he may even be a fictitious character like the
Eleatic Stranger. His name does not occur among
the Lokrians in the Catalogue of Pythagoreans
preserved by Iamblichos.<a id='r750' /><a href='#f750' class='c014'><sup>[750]</sup></a> Besides this, the work
does not fulfil the most important requirement, that
of being in three books, which is always an essential
feature of the story.<a id='r751' /><a href='#f751' class='c014'><sup>[751]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Not one of the writers just mentioned professes to
have seen the famous “three books”;<a id='r752' /><a href='#f752' class='c014'><sup>[752]</sup></a> but at a later
date there were at least two works which claimed to
represent them. Diels has shown how a treatise in
three sections, entitled Παιδευτικόν, πολιτικόν, φυσικόν,
was composed in the Ionic dialect and attributed to
Pythagoras. It was largely based on the Πυθαγορικαὶ
ἀποφάσεις of Aristoxenos, but its date is uncertain.<a id='r753' /><a href='#f753' class='c014'><sup>[753]</sup></a>
In the first century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, Demetrios Magnes was able
to quote the opening words of the work published by
Philolaos.<a id='r754' /><a href='#f754' class='c014'><sup>[754]</sup></a> That, however, was written in Doric.
Demetrios does not actually say it was by Philolaos
himself, though it is no doubt the same work from
which a number of extracts are preserved under his
name in Stobaios and later writers. If it professed to
be by Philolaos, that was not quite in accordance with
the original story; but it is easy to see how his name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>may have become attached to it. We are told that
the other book which passed under the name of
Pythagoras was really by Lysis.<a id='r755' /><a href='#f755' class='c014'><sup>[755]</sup></a> Boeckh has shown
that the work ascribed to Philolaos probably consisted
of three books also, and Proclus referred to it as the
<cite>Bakchai</cite>,<a id='r756' /><a href='#f756' class='c014'><sup>[756]</sup></a> a fanciful title which recalls the “Muses” of
Herodotos. Two of the extracts in Stobaios bear it.
It must be confessed that the whole story is very
suspicious; but, as some of the best authorities still
regard the fragments as partly genuine, it is necessary
to look at them more closely.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The “Fragments of Philolaos.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec141'></a>141. Boeckh argued with great learning and skill
that all the fragments preserved under the name of
Philolaos were genuine; but no one will now go so
far as this. The lengthy extract on the soul is given
up even by those who maintain the genuineness of the
rest.<a id='r757' /><a href='#f757' class='c014'><sup>[757]</sup></a> It cannot be said that this position is plausible
on the face of it. Boeckh saw there was no ground
for supposing that there ever was more than a single
work, and he drew the conclusion that we must accept
all the remains as genuine or reject all as spurious.<a id='r758' /><a href='#f758' class='c014'><sup>[758]</sup></a>
As, however, Zeller and Diels still maintain the
genuineness of most of the fragments, we cannot
ignore them altogether. Arguments based, on the
doctrine contained in them would, it is true, present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>the appearance of a vicious circle at this stage. It is
only in connexion with our other evidence that these
can be introduced. But there are two serious
objections to the fragments which may be mentioned
at once. They are sufficiently strong to justify us in
refusing to use them till we have ascertained from
other sources what doctrines may fairly be attributed
to the Pythagoreans of this date.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the first place, we must ask a question which
has not yet been faced. Is it likely that Philolaos
should have written in Doric? Ionic was the dialect
of all science and philosophy till the time of the
Peloponnesian War, and there is no reason to suppose
that the early Pythagoreans used any other.<a id='r759' /><a href='#f759' class='c014'><sup>[759]</sup></a> Pythagoras
was himself an Ionian, and it is by no means
clear that in his time the Achaian states in which he
founded his Order had already adopted the Dorian
dialect.<a id='r760' /><a href='#f760' class='c014'><sup>[760]</sup></a> Alkmaion of Kroton seems to have written
in Ionic.<a id='r761' /><a href='#f761' class='c014'><sup>[761]</sup></a> Diels says, it is true, that Philolaos and
then Archytas were the first Pythagoreans to use the
dialect of their homes;<a id='r762' /><a href='#f762' class='c014'><sup>[762]</sup></a> but Philolaos can hardly be
said to have had a home,<a id='r763' /><a href='#f763' class='c014'><sup>[763]</sup></a> and the fragments of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Archytas are not written in the dialect of Taras, but
in what may be called “common Doric.” Archytas
may have found it convenient to use that dialect; but
he is at least a generation later than Philolaos, which
makes a great difference. There is evidence that, in
the time of Philolaos and later, Ionic was still used
even by the citizens of Dorian states for scientific
purposes. Diogenes of Apollonia in Crete and the
Syracusan historian Antiochos wrote in Ionic, while
the medical writers of Dorian, Kos and Knidos,
continue to use the same dialect. The forged work
of Pythagoras referred to above, which some ascribed
to Lysis, was in Ionic; and so was the work on the
<em>Akousmata</em> attributed to Androkydes,<a id='r764' /><a href='#f764' class='c014'><sup>[764]</sup></a> which shows
that, even down to Alexandrian times, it was still
believed that Ionic was the proper dialect for Pythagorean
writings.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the second place, there can be no doubt that
one of the fragments refers to the five regular solids,
four of which are identified with the elements of
Empedokles.<a id='r765' /><a href='#f765' class='c014'><sup>[765]</sup></a> Now Plato gives us to understand, in
a well-known passage of the <cite>Republic</cite>, that stereometry
had not been adequately investigated at the time he
wrote,<a id='r766' /><a href='#f766' class='c014'><sup>[766]</sup></a> and we have express testimony that the five
“Platonic figures,” as they were called, were discovered
in the Academy. In the Scholia to Euclid we read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>that the Pythagoreans only knew the cube, the
pyramid (tetrahedron), and the dodecahedron, while the
octahedron and the icosahedron were discovered by
Theaitetos.<a id='r767' /><a href='#f767' class='c014'><sup>[767]</sup></a> This sufficiently justifies us in regarding
the “fragments of Philolaos” with something more
than suspicion. We shall find more anachronisms as
we go on.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Problem.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec142'></a>142. We must look, then, for other evidence.
From what has been said, it will be clear that we
cannot safely take Plato as our guide to the original
meaning of the Pythagorean theory, though it is
certainly from him alone that we can learn to regard
it sympathetically. Aristotle, on the other hand, was
quite out of sympathy with Pythagorean ways of
thinking, but took a great deal of pains to understand
them. This was just because they played so great a
part in the philosophy of Plato and his successors, and
he had to make the relation of the two doctrines as
clear as he could to himself and his disciples. What
we have to do, then, is to interpret what Aristotle tells
us in the spirit of Plato, and then to consider how the
doctrine we arrive at in this way is related to the
systems which had preceded it. It is a delicate
operation, no doubt, but it has been made much safer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>by recent discoveries in the early history of mathematics
and medicine.</p>

<p class='c002'>Zeller has cleared the ground by eliminating the
purely Platonic elements which have crept into later
accounts of the system. These are of two kinds.
First of all, we have genuine Academic formulae, such
as the identification of the Limit and the Unlimited
with the One and the Indeterminate Dyad;<a id='r768' /><a href='#f768' class='c014'><sup>[768]</sup></a> and
secondly, there is the Neoplatonic doctrine which
represents it as an opposition between God and
Matter.<a id='r769' /><a href='#f769' class='c014'><sup>[769]</sup></a> It is not necessary to repeat Zeller’s
arguments here, as no one will any longer attribute
these doctrines to the Pythagoreans of the fifth
century.</p>

<p class='c002'>This simplifies the problem very considerably, but
it is still extremely difficult. According to Aristotle,
the Pythagoreans said <em>Things are numbers</em>, though that
does not appear to be the doctrine of the fragments of
“Philolaos.” According to them, things <em>have</em> number,
which make them knowable, while their real essence is
something unknowable.<a id='r770' /><a href='#f770' class='c014'><sup>[770]</sup></a> That would be intelligible
enough, but the formula that things <em>are</em> numbers seems
meaningless. We have seen reason for believing that
it is due to Pythagoras himself (<a href='#sec52'>§ 52</a>), though we did
not feel able to say very clearly what he meant by it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>There is no such doubt as to his school. Aristotle
says they used the formula in a cosmological sense.
The world, according to them, was made of numbers
in the same sense as others had said it was made of
“four roots” or “innumerable seeds.” It will not do
to dismiss this as mysticism. Whatever we may think
of Pythagoras, the Pythagoreans of the fifth century
were scientific men, and they must have meant something
quite definite. We shall, no doubt, have to say
that they used the words <em>Things are numbers</em> in a
somewhat non-natural sense, but there is no difficulty
in such a supposition. We have seen already how the
friends of Aristoxenos reinterpreted the old <em>Akousmata</em>
(<a href='#sec44'>§ 44</a>). The Pythagoreans had certainly a great
veneration for the actual words of the Master (αὐτὸς
ἔφα); but such veneration is often accompanied by a
singular licence of interpretation. We shall start,
then, from what Aristotle tells us about the numbers.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Aristotle on the <a id='corr331.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Number'>Numbers</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_331.19'><ins class='correction' title='Number'>Numbers</ins></a></span>.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec143'></a>143. In the first place, Aristotle is quite decided
in his opinion that Pythagoreanism was intended to
be a cosmological system like the others. “Though
the Pythagoreans,” he tells us, “made use of less
obvious first principles and elements than the rest,
seeing that they did not derive them from sensible
objects, yet all their discussions and studies had
reference to nature alone. They describe the origin
of the heavens, and they observe the phenomena of its
parts, all that happens to it and all it does.”<a id='r771' /><a href='#f771' class='c014'><sup>[771]</sup></a> They
apply their first principles entirely to these things,
“agreeing apparently with the other natural philosophers
in holding that reality was just what could be perceived
by the senses, and is contained within the compass of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>the heavens,”<a id='r772' /><a href='#f772' class='c014'><sup>[772]</sup></a> though “the first principles and causes
of which they made use were really adequate to
explain realities of a higher order than the sensible.”<a id='r773' /><a href='#f773' class='c014'><sup>[773]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The doctrine is more precisely stated by Aristotle
to be that the elements of numbers are the elements of
things, and that therefore things are numbers.<a id='r774' /><a href='#f774' class='c014'><sup>[774]</sup></a> He
is equally positive that these “things” are sensible
things,<a id='r775' /><a href='#f775' class='c014'><sup>[775]</sup></a> and indeed that they are bodies,<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c014'><sup>[776]</sup></a> the bodies of
which the world is constructed.<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c014'><sup>[777]</sup></a> This construction of
the world out of numbers was a real process in time,
which the Pythagoreans described in detail.<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c014'><sup>[778]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Further, the numbers were intended to be mathematical
numbers, though they were not separated from
the things of sense.<a id='r779' /><a href='#f779' class='c014'><sup>[779]</sup></a> On the other hand, they were
not mere predicates of something else, but had an
independent reality of their own. “They did not hold
that the limited and the unlimited and the one were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>certain other substances, such as fire, water, or anything
else of that sort; but that the unlimited itself and the
one itself were the reality of the things of which they
are predicated, and that is why they said that number
was the reality of everything.”<a id='r780' /><a href='#f780' class='c014'><sup>[780]</sup></a> Accordingly the
numbers are, in Aristotle’s own language, not only the
formal, but also the material, cause of things.<a id='r781' /><a href='#f781' class='c014'><sup>[781]</sup></a>
According to the Pythagoreans, things are made of
numbers in the same sense as they were made of fire,
air, or water in the theories of their predecessors.</p>

<p class='c002'>Lastly, Aristotle notes that the point in which the
Pythagoreans agreed with Plato was in giving numbers
an independent reality of their own; while Plato
differed from the Pythagoreans in holding that this
reality was distinguishable from that of sensible things.<a id='r782' /><a href='#f782' class='c014'><sup>[782]</sup></a>
Let us consider these statements in detail.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The elements of numbers.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec144'></a>144. Aristotle speaks of certain “elements”
(στοιχεῖα) of numbers, which were also the elements of
things. That, of course, is only his own way of
putting the matter; but it is clearly the key to the
problem, if we can discover what it means. Primarily,
the “elements of number” are the Odd and
the Even, but that does not seem to help us much.
We find, however, that the Odd and Even were
identified in a somewhat violent way with the Limit
and the Unlimited, which we have seen reason to
regard as the original principles of the Pythagorean
cosmology. Aristotle tells us that it is the Even which
gives things their unlimited character when it is
contained in them and limited by the Odd,<a id='r783' /><a href='#f783' class='c014'><sup>[783]</sup></a> and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>commentators are at one in understanding this to
mean that the Even is in some way the cause of
infinite divisibility. They get into great difficulties,
however, when they try to show how this can be.
Simplicius has preserved an explanation, in all probability
Alexander’s, to the effect that they called the
even number unlimited “because every even is divided
into equal parts, and what is divided into equal parts
is unlimited in respect of bipartition; for division into
equals and halves goes on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad infinitum</i></span>. But, when
the odd is added, it limits it; for it prevents its
division into equal parts.”<a id='r784' /><a href='#f784' class='c014'><sup>[784]</sup></a> Now it is plain that we
must not impute to the Pythagoreans the view that
even numbers can be halved indefinitely. They had
carefully studied the properties of the decad, and
they must have known that the even numbers 6
and 10 do not admit of this. The explanation is
really to be found in a fragment of Aristoxenos,
where we read that “even numbers are those which
are divided into equal parts, while odd numbers are
divided into unequal parts and have a middle
term.”<a id='r785' /><a href='#f785' class='c014'><sup>[785]</sup></a> This is still further elucidated by a passage
which is quoted in Stobaios and ultimately goes
back to Poseidonios. It runs: “When the odd is
divided into two equal parts, a unit is left over in the
middle; but when the even is so divided, an empty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>field is left, without a master and without a number,
showing that it is defective and incomplete.”<a id='r786' /><a href='#f786' class='c014'><sup>[786]</sup></a> Again,
Plutarch says: “In the division of numbers, the even,
when parted in any direction, leaves as it were within
itself ... a field; but, when the same thing is done
to the odd, there is always a middle left over from the
division.”<a id='r787' /><a href='#f787' class='c014'><sup>[787]</sup></a> It is clear that all these passages refer to
the same thing, and that can hardly be anything else
than those arrangements of “terms” in patterns with
which we are already familiar (<a href='#sec47'>§ 47</a>). If we think of
these, we shall see in what sense it is true that
bipartition goes on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad infinitum</i></span>. However high the
number may be, the number of ways in which it can
be equally divided will also increase.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec145'></a>145. In this way, then, the Odd and the Even
were identified with the Limit and the Unlimited, and
it is possible, though by no means certain, that
Pythagoras himself had taken this step. In any case,
there can be no doubt that by his Unlimited he meant
something spatially extended, and we have seen that
he identified it with air, night, or the void, so we are
prepared to find that his followers also thought of the
Unlimited as extended. Aristotle certainly regarded
it so. He argues that, if the Unlimited is itself a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>reality, and not merely the predicate of some other
reality, then every part of it must be unlimited too,
just as every part of air is air.<a id='r788' /><a href='#f788' class='c014'><sup>[788]</sup></a> The same thing is
implied in his statement that the Pythagorean Unlimited
was outside the heavens.<a id='r789' /><a href='#f789' class='c014'><sup>[789]</sup></a> Further than this, it is
hardly safe to go. Philolaos and his followers cannot
have regarded the Unlimited in the old Pythagorean
way as Air; for, as we shall see, they adopted the
theory of Empedokles as to that “element,” and
accounted for it otherwise. On the other hand, they
can hardly have regarded it as an absolute void; for
that conception was introduced by the Atomists. It is
enough to say that they meant by the Unlimited the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>res
extensa</i></span>, without analysing that conception any further.</p>

<p class='c002'>As the Unlimited is spatial, the Limit must be
spatial too, and we should naturally expect to find that
the point, the line, and the surface were regarded as all
forms of the Limit. That was the later doctrine; but
the characteristic feature of Pythagoreanism is just that
the point was not regarded as a limit, but as the first
product of the Limit and the Unlimited, and was
identified with the arithmetical unit. According to
this view, then, the point has one dimension, the line
two, the surface three, and the solid four.<a id='r790' /><a href='#f790' class='c014'><sup>[790]</sup></a> In other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>words, the Pythagorean points have magnitude, their
lines breadth, and their surfaces thickness. The whole
theory, in short, turns on the definition of the point
as a unit “having position.”<a id='r791' /><a href='#f791' class='c014'><sup>[791]</sup></a> It was out of such
elements that it seemed possible to construct a
world.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The numbers as magnitudes.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec146'></a>146. It is clear that this way of regarding the point,
the line, and the surface is closely bound up with the
practice of representing numbers by dots arranged in
symmetrical patterns, which we have seen reason for
attributing to the Pythagoreans (<a href='#sec47'>§ 47</a>). The science
of geometry had already made considerable advances,
but the old view of quantity as a sum of units had not
been revised, and so a doctrine such as we have
indicated was inevitable. This is the true answer to
Zeller’s contention that to regard the Pythagorean
numbers as spatial is to ignore the fact that the
doctrine was originally arithmetical rather than
geometrical. Our interpretation takes full account of
that fact, and indeed makes the peculiarities of the
whole system depend upon it. Aristotle is very
decided as to the Pythagorean points having magnitude.
“They construct the whole world out of numbers,” he
tells us, “but they suppose the units have magnitude.
As to how the first unit with magnitude arose, they
appear to be at a loss.”<a id='r792' /><a href='#f792' class='c014'><sup>[792]</sup></a> Zeller holds that this is
only an inference of Aristotle’s,<a id='r793' /><a href='#f793' class='c014'><sup>[793]</sup></a> and he is probably
right in this sense, that the Pythagoreans never felt
the need of saying in so many words that points had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>magnitude. It does seem probable, however, that
they called them ὄγκοι.<a id='r794' /><a href='#f794' class='c014'><sup>[794]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Nor is Zeller’s other argument against the view
that the Pythagorean numbers were spatial any more
inconsistent with the way in which we have now stated
it. He himself allows, and indeed insists, that in the
Pythagorean cosmology the numbers were spatial, but
he raises difficulties about the other parts of the system.
There are other things, such as the Soul and Justice
and Opportunity, which are said to be numbers, and
which cannot be regarded as constructed of points,
lines, and surfaces.<a id='r795' /><a href='#f795' class='c014'><sup>[795]</sup></a> Now it appears to me that this
is just the meaning of a passage in which Aristotle
criticises the Pythagoreans. They held, he says, that
in one part of the world Opinion prevailed, while a
little above it or below it were to be found Injustice
or Separation or Mixture, each of which was, according
to them, a number. But in the very same regions
of the heavens were to be found things having
magnitude which were also numbers. How can this
be, since Justice has no magnitude?<a id='r796' /><a href='#f796' class='c014'><sup>[796]</sup></a> This means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>surely that the Pythagoreans had failed to give any
clear account of the relation between these more or less
fanciful analogies and their quasi-geometrical construction
of the universe. And this is, after all, really Zeller’s
own view. He has shown that in the Pythagorean
cosmology the numbers were regarded as spatial,<a id='r797' /><a href='#f797' class='c014'><sup>[797]</sup></a> and
he has also shown that the cosmology was the whole
of the system.<a id='r798' /><a href='#f798' class='c014'><sup>[798]</sup></a> We have only to bring these two
things together to arrive at the interpretation given
above.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The numbers and the elements.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec147'></a>147. When we come to details, we seem to see that
what distinguished the Pythagoreanism of this period
from its earlier form was that it sought to adapt itself
to the new theory of “elements.” It is just this which
makes it necessary for us to take up the consideration
of the system once more in connexion with the
pluralists. When the Pythagoreans returned to
Southern Italy, they must have found views prevalent
there which imperatively demanded a partial reconstruction
of their own system. We do not know that
Empedokles founded a philosophical society, but there
can be no doubt of his influence on the medical school
of these regions; and we also know now that Philolaos
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>played a part in the history of medicine.<a id='r799' /><a href='#f799' class='c014'><sup>[799]</sup></a> This discovery
gives us the clue to the historical connexion,
which formerly seemed obscure. The tradition is that
the Pythagoreans explained the elements as built up
of geometrical figures, a theory which we can study
for ourselves in the more developed form which it
attained in Plato’s <cite>Timaeus</cite>.<a id='r800' /><a href='#f800' class='c014'><sup>[800]</sup></a> If they were to retain
their position as the leaders of medical study in Italy,
they were bound to account for the elements.</p>

<p class='c002'>We must not take it for granted, however, that the
Pythagorean construction of the elements was exactly
the same as that which we find in Plato’s <cite>Timaeus</cite>.
It has been mentioned already that there is good
reason for believing they only knew three of the regular
solids, the cube, the pyramid (tetrahedron), and the
dodecahedron.<a id='r801' /><a href='#f801' class='c014'><sup>[801]</sup></a> Now it is very significant that Plato
starts from fire and earth,<a id='r802' /><a href='#f802' class='c014'><sup>[802]</sup></a> and in the construction of
the elements proceeds in such a way that the octahedron
and the icosahedron can easily be transformed into
pyramids, while the cube and the dodecahedron cannot.
From this it follows that, while air and water pass
readily into fire, earth cannot do so,<a id='r803' /><a href='#f803' class='c014'><sup>[803]</sup></a> and the dodecahedron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>is reserved for another purpose, which we shall
consider presently. This would exactly suit the
Pythagorean system; for it would leave room for a
dualism of the kind outlined in the Second Part of the
poem of Parmenides. We know that Hippasos made
Fire the first principle, and we see from the <cite>Timaeus</cite>
how it would be possible to represent air and water as
forms of fire. The other element is, however, earth,
not air, as we have seen reason to believe that it was
in early Pythagoreanism. That would be a natural result
of the discovery of atmospheric air by Empedokles
and of his general theory of the elements. It would
also explain the puzzling fact, which we had to leave
unexplained above, that Aristotle identifies the two
“forms” spoken of by Parmenides with Fire and
Earth.<a id='r804' /><a href='#f804' class='c014'><sup>[804]</sup></a> All this is, of course, problematical; but it
will not be found easy to account otherwise for the
facts.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The dodecahedron.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec148'></a>148. The most interesting point in the theory is,
perhaps, the use made of the dodecahedron. It was
identified, we are told, with the “sphere of the universe,”
or, as it is put in the Philolaic fragment, with the “hull
of the sphere.”<a id='r805' /><a href='#f805' class='c014'><sup>[805]</sup></a> Whatever we may think of the authenticity
of the fragments, there is no reason to doubt that
this is a genuine Pythagorean expression, and it must
be taken in close connexion with the word “keel”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>applied to the central fire.<a id='r806' /><a href='#f806' class='c014'><sup>[806]</sup></a> The structure of the
world was compared to the building of a ship, an idea
of which there are other traces.<a id='r807' /><a href='#f807' class='c014'><sup>[807]</sup></a> The key to what we
are told of the dodecahedron is given by Plato. In
the <cite>Phaedo</cite> we read that the “true earth,” if looked at
from above, is “many-coloured like the balls that are
made of twelve pieces of leather.”<a id='r808' /><a href='#f808' class='c014'><sup>[808]</sup></a> In the <cite>Timaeus</cite> the
same thing is referred to in these words: “Further,
as there is still one construction left, the fifth, God
made use of it for the universe when he painted it.”<a id='r809' /><a href='#f809' class='c014'><sup>[809]</sup></a>
The point is that the dodecahedron approaches more
nearly to the sphere than any other of the regular
solids. The twelve pieces of leather used to make a
ball would all be regular pentagons; and, if the
material were not flexible like leather, we should have
a dodecahedron instead of a sphere. This points to
the Pythagoreans having had at least the rudiments
of the “method of exhaustion” formulated later by
Eudoxos. They must have studied the properties of
circles by means of inscribed polygons and those of
spheres by means of inscribed solids.<a id='r810' /><a href='#f810' class='c014'><sup>[810]</sup></a> That gives us
a high idea of their mathematical attainments; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>that it is not too high, is shown by the fact that the
famous lunules of Hippokrates date from the middle
of the fifth century. The inclusion of <em>straight</em>
and <em>curved</em> in the “table of opposites” under the
head of Limit and Unlimited points in the same
direction.<a id='r811' /><a href='#f811' class='c014'><sup>[811]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The tradition confirms in an interesting way the
importance of the dodecahedron in the Pythagorean
system. According to one account, Hippasos was
drowned at sea for revealing its construction and claiming
the discovery as his own.<a id='r812' /><a href='#f812' class='c014'><sup>[812]</sup></a> What that construction
was, we may partially infer from the fact that the
Pythagoreans adopted the pentagram or <em>pentalpha</em> as
their symbol. The use of this figure in later magic is
well known; and Paracelsus still employed it as a
symbol of health, which is exactly what the Pythagoreans
called it.<a id='r813' /><a href='#f813' class='c014'><sup>[813]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Soul a “Harmony.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec149'></a>149. The view that the soul is a “harmony,” or
rather an attunement, is intimately connected with the
theory of the four elements. It cannot have belonged
to the earliest form of Pythagoreanism; for, as shown
in Plato’s <cite>Phaedo</cite>, it is quite inconsistent with the idea
that the soul can exist independently of the body. It
is the very opposite of the belief that “any soul can
enter any body.”<a id='r814' /><a href='#f814' class='c014'><sup>[814]</sup></a> On the other hand, we know also
from the <cite>Phaedo</cite> that it was accepted by Simmias and
Kebes, who had heard Philolaos at Thebes, and by
Echekrates of Phleious, who was the disciple of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>Philolaos and Eurytos.<a id='r815' /><a href='#f815' class='c014'><sup>[815]</sup></a> The account of the doctrine
given by Plato is quite in accordance with the view
that it was of medical origin. Simmias says: “Our
body being, as it were, strung and held together by
the warm and the cold, the dry and the moist, and
things of that sort, our soul is a sort of temperament
and attunement of these, when they are mingled with
one another well and in due proportion. If, then, our
soul is an attunement, it is clear that, when the body
has been relaxed or strung up out of measure by
diseases and other ills, the soul must necessarily perish
at once.”<a id='r816' /><a href='#f816' class='c014'><sup>[816]</sup></a> This is clearly an application of the theory
of Alkmaion (<a href='#sec96'>§ 96</a>), and is in accordance with the
views of the Sicilian school of medicine. It completes
the evidence that the Pythagoreanism of the end of
the fifth century was an adaptation of the old doctrine
to the new principles introduced by Empedokles.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The central fire.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec150'></a>150. The planetary system which Aristotle attributes
to “the Pythagoreans” and Aetios to Philolaos is
sufficiently remarkable.<a id='r817' /><a href='#f817' class='c014'><sup>[817]</sup></a> The earth is no longer in
the middle of the world; its place is taken by a
central fire, which is not to be identified with the sun.
Round this fire revolve ten bodies. First comes the
<em>Antichthon</em> or Counter-earth, and next the earth, which
thus becomes one of the planets. After the earth
comes the moon, then the sun, the five planets, and
the heaven of the fixed stars. We do not see the
central fire and the <em>antichthon</em> because the side of the
earth on which we live is always turned away from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>them. This is to be explained by the analogy of the
moon. That body always presents the same face to
us; and men living on the other side of it would never
see the earth. This implies, of course, that all these
bodies rotate on their axes in the same time as they
revolve round the central fire.<a id='r818' /><a href='#f818' class='c014'><sup>[818]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It is not very easy to accept the view that this
system was taught by Philolaos. Aristotle nowhere
mentions him in connexion with it, and in the <cite>Phaedo</cite>
Plato gives a description of the earth and its position
in the world which is entirely opposed to it, but is
accepted without demur by Simmias the disciple of
Philolaos.<a id='r819' /><a href='#f819' class='c014'><sup>[819]</sup></a> It is undoubtedly a Pythagorean theory,
however, and marks a noticeable advance on the
Ionian views then current at Athens. It is clear too
that Plato states it as something of a novelty that the
earth does not require the support of air or anything
of the sort to keep it in its place. Even Anaxagoras
had not been able to shake himself free of that idea,
and Demokritos still held it.<a id='r820' /><a href='#f820' class='c014'><sup>[820]</sup></a> The natural inference
from the <cite>Phaedo</cite> would certainly be that the theory of
a spherical earth, kept in the middle of the world by
its equilibrium, was that of Philolaos himself. If so,
the doctrine of the central fire would belong to a somewhat
later generation of the school, and Plato may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>have learnt it from Archytas and his friends after he
had written the <cite>Phaedo</cite>. However that may be, it is
of such importance that it cannot be omitted here.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is commonly supposed that the revolution of the
earth round the central fire was intended to account
for the alternation of day and night, and it is clear that
an orbital motion of the kind just described would
have the same effect as the rotation of the earth on its
axis. As the same side of the earth is always turned
to the central fire, the side upon which we live will
be turned towards the sun when the earth is on the
same side of the central fire, and turned away from it
when the earth and sun are on opposite sides. This
view appears to derive some support from the statement
of Aristotle that the earth “being in motion
round the centre, produces day and night.”<a id='r821' /><a href='#f821' class='c014'><sup>[821]</sup></a> That
remark, however, would prove too much; for in the
<cite>Timaeus</cite> Plato calls the earth “the guardian and
artificer of night and day,” while at the same time he
declares that the alternation of day and night is caused
by the diurnal revolution of the heavens.<a id='r822' /><a href='#f822' class='c014'><sup>[822]</sup></a> That is
explained, no doubt quite rightly, by saying that, even
if the earth were regarded as at rest, it could still be
said to produce day and night; for night is due to
the intervention of the earth between the sun and the
hemisphere opposite to it. If we remember how recent
was the discovery that night was the shadow of the
earth, we shall see how it may have been worth while
to say this explicitly.</p>

<p class='c002'>In any case, it is wholly incredible that the heaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>of the fixed stars should have been regarded as
stationary. That would have been the most startling
paradox that any scientific man had yet propounded,
and we should have expected the comic poets and
popular literature generally to raise the cry of atheism
at once. Above all, we should have expected Aristotle
to say something about it. He made the circular
motion of the heavens the very keystone of his system,
and would have regarded the theory of a stationary
heaven as blasphemous. Now he argues against those
who, like the Pythagoreans and Plato, regarded the
earth as in motion;<a id='r823' /><a href='#f823' class='c014'><sup>[823]</sup></a> but he does not attribute the
view that the heavens are stationary to any one. There
is no necessary connexion between the two ideas. All
the heavenly bodies may be moving as rapidly as we
please, provided that their relative motions are such
as to account for the phenomena.<a id='r824' /><a href='#f824' class='c014'><sup>[824]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It seems probable that the theory of the earth’s
revolution round the central fire really originated in
the account given by Empedokles of the sun’s light.
The two things are brought into close connexion by
Aetios, who says that Empedokles believed in two
suns, while Philolaos believed in two or even in three.<a id='r825' /><a href='#f825' class='c014'><sup>[825]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>The theory of Empedokles is unsatisfactory in so far
as it gives two inconsistent explanations of night. It
is, we have seen, the shadow of the earth; but at the
same time Empedokles recognised a fiery diurnal
hemisphere and a nocturnal hemisphere with only a
little fire in it.<a id='r826' /><a href='#f826' class='c014'><sup>[826]</sup></a> All this could be simplified by the
hypothesis of a central fire which is the true source of
light. Such a theory would, in fact, be the natural
issue of the recent discoveries as to the moon’s light
and the cause of eclipses, if that theory were extended
so as to include the sun.</p>

<p class='c002'>The central fire received a number of mythological
names. It was called the Hestia or “hearth of the
universe,” the “house” or “watch-tower” of Zeus, and
the “mother of the gods.”<a id='r827' /><a href='#f827' class='c014'><sup>[827]</sup></a> That was in the manner
of the school; but these names must not blind us to
the fact that we are dealing with a real scientific
hypothesis. It was a great thing to see that the
phenomena could best be “saved” by a central
luminary, and that the earth must therefore be a revolving
sphere like the planets. Indeed, we are almost
tempted to say that the identification of the central
fire with the sun, which was suggested for the first time
in the Academy, is a mere detail in comparison. The
great thing was that the earth should definitely take
its place among the planets; for once it has done so,
we can proceed to search for the true “hearth” of
the planetary system at our leisure. It is probable, at
any rate, that it was this theory which made it possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>for Herakleides of Pontos and Aristarchos of Samos
to reach the heliocentric hypothesis,<a id='r828' /><a href='#f828' class='c014'><sup>[828]</sup></a> and it was
certainly Aristotle’s reversion to the geocentric theory
which made it necessary for Copernicus to discover the
truth afresh. We have his own word for it that the
Pythagorean theory put him on the right track.<a id='r829' /><a href='#f829' class='c014'><sup>[829]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The <em>antichthon</em>.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec151'></a>151. The existence of the <em>antichthon</em> was also a
hypothesis intended to account for the phenomena of
eclipses. In one place, indeed, Aristotle says that the
Pythagoreans invented it in order to bring the number
of revolving bodies up to ten;<a id='r830' /><a href='#f830' class='c014'><sup>[830]</sup></a> but that is a mere
sally, and Aristotle really knew better. In his work
on the Pythagoreans, we are told, he said that eclipses
of the moon were caused sometimes by the intervention
of the earth and sometimes by that of the
<em>antichthon</em>; and the same statement was made by
Philip of Opous, a very competent authority on the
matter.<a id='r831' /><a href='#f831' class='c014'><sup>[831]</sup></a> Indeed, Aristotle shows in another passage
exactly how the theory originated. He tells us that
some thought there might be a considerable number
of bodies revolving round the centre, though invisible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>to us because of the intervention of the earth, and that
they accounted in this way for there being more
eclipses of the moon than of the sun.<a id='r832' /><a href='#f832' class='c014'><sup>[832]</sup></a> This is
mentioned in close connexion with the <em>antichthon</em>, so
there is no doubt that Aristotle regarded the two
hypotheses as of the same nature. The history of the
theory seems to be this. Anaximenes had assumed
the existence of dark planets to account for the
frequency of lunar eclipses (<a href='#sec29'>§ 29</a>), and Anaxagoras
had revived that view (<a href='#sec135'>§ 135</a>). Certain Pythagoreans<a id='r833' /><a href='#f833' class='c014'><sup>[833]</sup></a>
had placed these dark planets between the earth and
the central fire in order to account for their invisibility,
and the next stage was to reduce them to a single
body. Here again we see how the Pythagoreans tried
to simplify the hypotheses of their predecessors.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Planetary motions.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec152'></a>152. We must not assume that even the later Pythagoreans
made the sun, moon, and planets, including the
earth, revolve in the opposite direction to the heaven of
the fixed stars. It is true that Alkmaion is said to
have agreed with “some of the mathematicians”<a id='r834' /><a href='#f834' class='c014'><sup>[834]</sup></a> in
holding this view, but it is never ascribed to Pythagoras
or even to Philolaos. The old theory was, as we have
seen (<a href='#sec54'>§ 54</a>), that all the heavenly bodies revolved in the
same direction, from east to west, but that the planets
revolved more slowly the further they were removed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>from the heavens, so that those which are nearest the
earth are “overtaken” by those that are further away.
This view was still maintained by Demokritos, and that
it was also Pythagorean, seems to follow from what we
are told about the “harmony of the spheres.” We
have seen (<a href='#sec54'>§ 54</a>) that we cannot attribute this theory
in its later form to the Pythagoreans of the fifth
century, but we have the express testimony of Aristotle
to the fact that those Pythagoreans whose doctrine he
knew believed that the heavenly bodies produced
musical notes in their courses. Further, the velocities
of these bodies depended on the distances between
them, and these corresponded to the intervals of the
octave. He distinctly implies that the heaven of the
fixed stars takes part in the concert; for he mentions
“the sun, the moon, and the stars, so great in magnitude
and in number as they are,” a phrase which cannot
refer solely or chiefly to the remaining five planets.<a id='r835' /><a href='#f835' class='c014'><sup>[835]</sup></a>
Further, we are told that the slower bodies give out
a deep note and the swifter a high note.<a id='r836' /><a href='#f836' class='c014'><sup>[836]</sup></a> Now the
prevailing tradition gives the high note of the octave to
the heaven of the fixed stars,<a id='r837' /><a href='#f837' class='c014'><sup>[837]</sup></a> from which it follows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>that all the heavenly bodies revolve in the same
direction, and that their velocity increases in proportion
to their distance from the centre.</p>

<p class='c002'>The theory that the proper motion of the sun,
moon, and planets is from west to east, and that they
also share in the motion from east to west of the
heaven of the fixed stars, makes its first appearance in
the Myth of Er in Plato’s <cite>Republic</cite>, and is fully worked
out in the <cite>Timaeus</cite>. In the <cite>Republic</cite> it is still associated
with the “harmony of the spheres,” though we are not
told how it is reconciled with that theory in detail.<a id='r838' /><a href='#f838' class='c014'><sup>[838]</sup></a>
In the <cite>Timaeus</cite> we read that the slowest of the heavenly
bodies appear the fastest and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>; and, as this
statement is put into the mouth of a Pythagorean, we
might suppose the theory of a composite movement to
have been anticipated by some members at least of
that school.<a id='r839' /><a href='#f839' class='c014'><sup>[839]</sup></a> That is, of course, possible; for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Pythagoreans were singularly open to new ideas. At
the same time, we must note that the theory is even
more emphatically expressed by the Athenian Stranger
in the <cite>Laws</cite>, who is in a special sense Plato himself.
If we were to praise the runners who come in last in
the race, we should not do what is pleasing to the
competitors; and in the same way it cannot be pleasing
to the gods when we suppose the slowest of the
heavenly bodies to be the fastest. The passage undoubtedly
conveys the impression that Plato is expounding
a novel theory.<a id='r840' /><a href='#f840' class='c014'><sup>[840]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Things likenesses of numbers.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec153'></a>153. We have still to consider a view, which
Aristotle sometimes attributes to the Pythagoreans,
that things were “like numbers.” He does not appear
to regard this as inconsistent with the doctrine that
things <em>are</em> numbers, though it is hard to see how he
could reconcile the two.<a id='r841' /><a href='#f841' class='c014'><sup>[841]</sup></a> There is no doubt, however,
that Aristoxenos represented the Pythagoreans as
teaching that things were <em>like</em> numbers,<a id='r842' /><a href='#f842' class='c014'><sup>[842]</sup></a> and there are
other traces of an attempt to make out that this was
the original doctrine. A letter was produced, purporting
to be by Theano, the wife of Pythagoras, in which
she says that she hears many of the Hellenes think
Pythagoras said things were made <em>of</em> number, whereas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>he really said they were made <em>according to</em> number.<a id='r843' /><a href='#f843' class='c014'><sup>[843]</sup></a>
It is amusing to notice that this fourth-century theory
had to be explained away in its turn later on, and
Iamblichos actually tells us that it was Hippasos who
said number was the exemplar of things.<a id='r844' /><a href='#f844' class='c014'><sup>[844]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>When this view is uppermost in his mind, Aristotle
seems to find only a verbal difference between Plato
and the Pythagoreans. The metaphor of “participation”
was merely substituted for that of “imitation.”
This is not the place to discuss the meaning of Plato’s
so-called “theory of ideas”; but it must be pointed
out that Aristotle’s ascription of the doctrine of
“imitation” to the Pythagoreans is abundantly
justified by the <cite>Phaedo</cite>. The arguments for immortality
given in the early part of that dialogue come from
various sources. Those derived from the doctrine of
Reminiscence, which has sometimes been supposed to
be Pythagorean, are only known to the Pythagoreans
by hearsay, and Simmias requires to have the whole
psychology of the subject explained to him.<a id='r845' /><a href='#f845' class='c014'><sup>[845]</sup></a> When,
however, we come to the question what it is that our
sensations remind us of, his attitude changes. The
view that the equal itself is alone real, and that what
we call equal things are imperfect imitations of it, is
quite familiar to him.<a id='r846' /><a href='#f846' class='c014'><sup>[846]</sup></a> He requires no proof of it, and
is finally convinced of the immortality of the soul just
because Sokrates makes him see that the theory of
forms implies it.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is also to be observed that Sokrates does not
introduce the theory as a novelty. The reality of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>“ideas” is the sort of reality “we are always talking
about,” and they are explained in a peculiar vocabulary
which is represented as that of a school. The technical
terms are introduced by such formulas as “we say.”<a id='r847' /><a href='#f847' class='c014'><sup>[847]</sup></a>
Whose theory is it? It is usually supposed to be
Plato’s own, though nowadays it is the fashion to call
it his “early theory of ideas,” and to say that he
modified it profoundly in later life. But there are
serious difficulties in this view. Plato is very careful
to tell us that he was not present at the conversation
recorded in the <cite>Phaedo</cite>. Did any philosopher ever
propound a new theory of his own by representing it
as already familiar to a number of distinguished living
contemporaries? It is not easy to believe that. It
would be rash, on the other hand, to ascribe the theory
to Sokrates, and there seems nothing for it but to
suppose that the doctrine of “forms” (εἴδη, ἰδέαι)
originally took shape in Pythagorean circles, perhaps
under Sokratic influence. There is nothing startling in
this. It is a historical fact that Simmias and Kebes
were not only Pythagoreans but disciples of Sokrates;
for, by a happy chance, the good Xenophon has included
them in his list of true Sokratics.<a id='r848' /><a href='#f848' class='c014'><sup>[848]</sup></a> We have also
sufficient ground for believing that the Megarians had
adopted a like theory under similar influences, and
Plato states expressly that Eukleides and Terpsion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>Megara were present at the conversation recorded in
the <cite>Phaedo</cite>. There were, no doubt, more “friends of
the ideas”<a id='r849' /><a href='#f849' class='c014'><sup>[849]</sup></a> than we generally recognise. It is certain,
in any case, that the use of the words εἴδη and ἰδέαι to
express ultimate realities is pre-Platonic, and it seems
most natural to regard it as of Pythagorean origin.<a id='r850' /><a href='#f850' class='c014'><sup>[850]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>We have really exceeded the limits of this work by
tracing the history of Pythagoreanism down to a point
where it becomes practically indistinguishable from the
earliest form of Platonism; but it was necessary to do
so in order to put the statements of our authorities in
their true light. Aristoxenos is not likely to have been
mistaken with regard to the opinions of the men he
had known personally, and Aristotle’s statements must
have had some foundation. We must assume, then,
a later form of Pythagoreanism which was closely akin
to early Platonism. That, however, is not the form of
it which concerns us here, and we shall see in the next
chapter that the fifth-century doctrine was of the more
primitive type already described.</p>

seem likely that the μυθολογῶν κομψὸς ἀνήρ of <cite>Gorg.</cite> 493 a 5 (R. P. 89 b)
is responsible for the whole theory there given. He is certainly, in any
case, the author of the τετρημένος πίθος, which implies the same general
view. Now he is called ἴσως Σικελός τις ἢ Ἰταλικός, which means he was
an Italian; for the Σικελός τις is merely an allusion to the Σικελὸς κομψὸς
ἀνὴρ ποτὶ τὰν ματέρ’ ἔφα of Timokreon. We do not know of any Italian
from whom Plato could have learnt these views except Philolaos or one of
his disciples. They may, however, be originally Orphic for all that (cf.

Euclid calls δυνάμει σύμμετρα, by the name of δυνάμεις, while rational
square roots were called μήκη. Now in <cite>Tim.</cite> 31 c 4 we find a division of
numbers into ὄγκοι and δυνάμεις, which seem to mean rational and irrational
quantities. Cf. also the use of ὄγκοι in <cite>Parm.</cite> 164 d. Zeno in his fourth
argument about motion, which, we shall see (<a href='#sec163'>§ 163</a>), was directed against the
Pythagoreans, used ὄγκοι for points. Aetios, i. 3, 19 (R. P. 76 b), says that
Ekphantos of Syracuse was the first of the Pythagoreans to say that their units
were corporeal. Probably, however, “Ekphantos” was a personage in
a dialogue of Herakleides (Tannery, <cite>Arch.</cite> xi. pp. 263 sqq.), and Herakleides
called the monads ἄναρμοι ὄγκοι (Galen, <cite>Hist. Phil.</cite> 18; <cite>Dox.</cite> p.

<p class='c002'><a href='#r796'>796</a>. Arist. <cite>Met.</cite> Α, 8. 990 a 22 (R. P. 81 e). I read and interpret thus:
“For, seeing that, according to them, Opinion and Opportunity are in
a given part of the world, and a little above or below them Injustice and
Separation and Mixture,—in proof of which they allege that each of these
is a number,—and seeing that it is also the case (reading συμβαίνῃ with
Bonitz) that there is already in that part of the world a number of composite
magnitudes (<i>i.e.</i> composed of the Limit and the Unlimited), because
those affections (of number) are attached to their respective regions;—(seeing
that they hold these two things), the question arises whether the
number which we are to understand each of these things (Opinion, etc.) to
be is the same as the number in the world (<i>i.e.</i> the cosmological number)
or a different one.” I cannot doubt that these are the extended numbers
which are composed (συνίσταται) of the elements of number, the limited
and the unlimited, or, as Aristotle here says, the “affections of number,”
the odd and the even. Zeller’s view that “celestial bodies” are meant
comes near this, but the application is too narrow. Nor is it the number
(πλῆθος) of those bodies that is in question, but their magnitude (μέγεθος).

is an anachronism, as the mention of “elements” shows it must be later

οἱ Πυθαγόρειοι, which doubtless represents Theophrastos better. There is

of the construction of the elements οὐδείς πω γένεσιν αὐτῶν μεμήνυκεν,
which implies that there is some novelty in the theory as he makes Timaios
state it. If we read the passage in the light of what has been said in § 141,
we shall be inclined to believe that Plato is working out the Pythagorean
doctrine on the lines of the discovery of Theaitetos. There is another
indication of the same thing in Arist. <cite>Gen. Corr.</cite> Β, 3. 330 b 16, where we

of an attempt to show how the heliocentric hypothesis arose from the
theory of Empedokles as to the sun’s light. The meaning is that the
central fire really was the sun, but that Philolaos unnecessarily duplicated
it by supposing the visible sun to be its reflexion.</p>

led to the return to the geocentric hypothesis and the exclusion of earth

make the earth rotate on its axis or revolve round the central fire in
twenty-four hours, leaving only precession for the ἀπλανής. As we have

the Pythagoreans is correct, we may say that the Pythagorean “forms”

<p class='c002'><a id='sec154'></a>154. The systems we have just been studying were
all fundamentally pluralist, and they were so because
Parmenides had shown that, if we take a corporeal
monism seriously, we must ascribe to reality a number
of predicates which are inconsistent with our experience
of a world which everywhere displays multiplicity,
motion, and change (<a href='#sec97'>§ 97</a>). The four “roots” of
Empedokles and the innumerable “seeds” of Anaxagoras
were both of them conscious attempts to solve
the problem which Parmenides had raised (§§ 106,
127). There is no evidence, indeed, that the Pythagoreans
were directly influenced by Parmenides, but it
has been shown (<a href='#sec147'>§ 147</a>) how the later form of their
system was based on the theory of Empedokles.
Now it was just this prevailing pluralism that Zeno
criticised from the Eleatic standpoint; and his arguments
were especially directed against Pythagoreanism.
Melissos, too, criticises Pythagoreanism; but he tries
to find a common ground with his adversaries by
maintaining the old Ionian thesis that reality is
infinite.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Life.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec155'></a>155. According to Apollodoros,<a id='r851' /><a href='#f851' class='c014'><sup>[851]</sup></a> Zeno flourished in
Ol. LXXIX. (464-460 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>). This date is arrived at
by making him forty years younger than his master
Parmenides. We have seen already (<a href='#sec84'>§ 84</a>) that the
meeting of Parmenides and Zeno with the young
Sokrates cannot well have occurred before 449 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>,
and Plato tells us that Zeno was at that time “nearly
forty years old.”<a id='r852' /><a href='#f852' class='c014'><sup>[852]</sup></a> He must, then, have been born
about 489 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, some twenty-five years after Parmenides.
He was the son of Teleutagoras, and the statement of
Apollodoros that he had been adopted by Parmenides
is only a misunderstanding of an expression of Plato’s
<cite>Sophist</cite>.<a id='r853' /><a href='#f853' class='c014'><sup>[853]</sup></a> He was, Plato further tells us,<a id='r854' /><a href='#f854' class='c014'><sup>[854]</sup></a> tall and of
a graceful appearance.</p>

<p class='c002'>Like Parmenides and most other early philosophers,
Zeno seems to have played a part in the politics of his
native city. Strabo ascribes to him some share of the
credit for the good government of Elea, and says that
he was a Pythagorean.<a id='r855' /><a href='#f855' class='c014'><sup>[855]</sup></a> This statement can easily be
explained. Parmenides, we have seen, was originally a
Pythagorean, and the school of Elea was no doubt
popularly regarded as a mere branch of the larger
society. We hear also that Zeno conspired against a
tyrant, whose name is differently given, and the story
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>of his courage under torture is often repeated, though
with varying details.<a id='r856' /><a href='#f856' class='c014'><sup>[856]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Writings.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec156'></a>156. Diogenes speaks of Zeno’s “books,” and
Souidas gives some titles which probably come from
the Alexandrian librarians through Hesychios of
Miletos.<a id='r857' /><a href='#f857' class='c014'><sup>[857]</sup></a> In the <cite>Parmenides</cite>, Plato makes Zeno say
that the work by which he is best known was written
in his youth and published against his will.<a id='r858' /><a href='#f858' class='c014'><sup>[858]</sup></a> As he
is supposed to be forty years old at the time of the
dialogue, this must mean that the book was written
before 460 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> (<a href='#sec84'>§ 84</a>), and it is very possible that he
wrote others after it. The most remarkable title which
has come down to us is that of the <cite>Interpretation of
Empedokles</cite>. It is not to be supposed, of course, that
Zeno wrote a commentary on the Poem of Empedokles;
but, as Diels has pointed out,<a id='r859' /><a href='#f859' class='c014'><sup>[859]</sup></a> it is quite credible that
he should have written an attack on it, which was
afterwards called by that name. If he wrote a work
against the “philosophers,” that must mean the
Pythagoreans, who, as we have seen, made use of
the term in a sense of their own.<a id='r860' /><a href='#f860' class='c014'><sup>[860]</sup></a> The <cite>Disputations</cite>
and the <cite>Treatise on Nature</cite> may, or may not, be the
same as the book described in Plato’s <cite>Parmenides</cite>.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is not likely that Zeno wrote dialogues, though
certain references in Aristotle have been supposed to
imply this. In the <cite>Physics</cite><a id='r861' /><a href='#f861' class='c014'><sup>[861]</sup></a> we hear of an argument
of Zeno’s, that any part of a heap of millet makes a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>sound, and Simplicius illustrates this by quoting a
passage from a dialogue between Zeno and Protagoras.<a id='r862' /><a href='#f862' class='c014'><sup>[862]</sup></a>
If our chronology is right, there is nothing impossible
in the idea that the two men may have met; but it
is most unlikely that Zeno should have made himself
a personage in a dialogue of his own. That was a
later fashion. In another place Aristotle refers to a
passage where “the answerer and Zeno the questioner”
occurred,<a id='r863' /><a href='#f863' class='c014'><sup>[863]</sup></a> a reference which is most easily to be understood
in the same way. Alkidamas seems to have
written a dialogue in which Gorgias figured,<a id='r864' /><a href='#f864' class='c014'><sup>[864]</sup></a> and the
exposition of Zeno’s arguments in dialogue form must
always have been a tempting exercise. It appears
also that Aristotle made Alexamenos the first writer
of dialogues.<a id='r865' /><a href='#f865' class='c014'><sup>[865]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Plato gives us a clear idea of what Zeno’s youthful
work was like. It contained more than one “discourse,”
and these discourses were subdivided into
sections, each dealing with some one presupposition
of his adversaries.<a id='r866' /><a href='#f866' class='c014'><sup>[866]</sup></a> We owe the preservation of Zeno’s
arguments on the one and many to Simplicius.<a id='r867' /><a href='#f867' class='c014'><sup>[867]</sup></a> Those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>relating to motion have been preserved by Aristotle
himself;<a id='r868' /><a href='#f868' class='c014'><sup>[868]</sup></a> but, as usual, he has restated them in his
own language.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Dialectic.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec157'></a>157. Aristotle in his <cite>Sophist</cite><a id='r869' /><a href='#f869' class='c014'><sup>[869]</sup></a> called Zeno the inventor
of dialectic, and this, no doubt, is substantially
true, though the beginnings at least of that method of
arguing were contemporary with the foundation of the
Eleatic school. Plato<a id='r870' /><a href='#f870' class='c014'><sup>[870]</sup></a> gives us a spirited account of
the style and purpose of Zeno’s book, which he puts
into his own mouth:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>In reality, this writing is a sort of reinforcement for the
argument of Parmenides against those who try to turn it into
ridicule on the ground that, if reality is one, the argument
becomes involved in many absurdities and contradictions.
This writing argues against those who uphold a Many, and
gives them back as good and better than they gave; its aim
is to show that their assumption of multiplicity will be involved
in still more absurdities than the assumption of unity, if it is
sufficiently worked out.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>The method of Zeno was, in fact, to take one of
his adversaries’ fundamental postulates and deduce
from it two contradictory conclusions.<a id='r871' /><a href='#f871' class='c014'><sup>[871]</sup></a> This is what
Aristotle meant by calling him the inventor of dialectic,
which is just the art of arguing, not from true premisses,
but from premisses admitted by the other side. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>theory of Parmenides had led to conclusions which
contradicted the evidence of the senses, and Zeno’s
object was not to bring fresh proofs of the theory
itself, but simply to show that his opponents’ view
led to contradictions of a precisely similar nature.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Zeno and Pythagoreanism.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec158'></a>158. That Zeno’s dialectic was mainly directed
against the Pythagoreans is certainly suggested by
Plato’s statement, that it was addressed to the
adversaries of Parmenides, who held that things were
“a many.”<a id='r872' /><a href='#f872' class='c014'><sup>[872]</sup></a> Zeller holds, indeed, that it was merely
the popular form of the belief that things are many
that Zeno set himself to confute;<a id='r873' /><a href='#f873' class='c014'><sup>[873]</sup></a> but it is surely not
true that ordinary people believe things to be “a many”
in the sense required. Plato tells us that the premisses
of Zeno’s arguments were the beliefs of the adversaries
of Parmenides, and the postulate from which all his
contradictions are derived is the view that space, and
therefore body, is made up of a number of discrete
units, which is just the Pythagorean doctrine. Nor
is it at all probable that Anaxagoras is aimed at.<a id='r874' /><a href='#f874' class='c014'><sup>[874]</sup></a>
We know from Plato that Zeno’s book was the work
of his youth.<a id='r875' /><a href='#f875' class='c014'><sup>[875]</sup></a> Suppose even that it was written when
he was thirty, that is to say, about 459 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, Anaxagoras
had just taken up his abode at Athens at that time,<a id='r876' /><a href='#f876' class='c014'><sup>[876]</sup></a>
and it is very unlikely that Zeno had ever heard of
him. There is, on the other hand, a great deal to be
said for the view that Anaxagoras had read the work
of Zeno, and that his emphatic adhesion to the doctrine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>of infinite divisibility was due to the criticism of his
younger contemporary.<a id='r877' /><a href='#f877' class='c014'><sup>[877]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>It will be noted how much clearer the historical
position of Zeno becomes if we follow Plato in assigning
him to a somewhat later date than is usual. We
have first Parmenides, then the pluralists, and then the
criticism of Zeno. This, at any rate, seems to have
been the view which Aristotle took of the historical
development.<a id='r878' /><a href='#f878' class='c014'><sup>[878]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>What is the unit?</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec159'></a>159. The polemic of Zeno is clearly directed in
the first instance against a certain view of the unit.
Eudemos, in his <cite>Physics</cite>,<a id='r879' /><a href='#f879' class='c014'><sup>[879]</sup></a> quoted from him the saying
that “if any one could tell him what the one was, he
would be able to say what things are.” The commentary
of Alexander on this, preserved by Simplicius,<a id='r880' /><a href='#f880' class='c014'><sup>[880]</sup></a>
is quite satisfactory. “As Eudemos relates,” he says,
“Zeno the disciple of Parmenides tried to show that
it was impossible that things could be a many, seeing
that there was no unit in things, whereas ‘many’
means a number of units.” Here we have a clear reference
to the Pythagorean view that everything may be
reduced to a sum of units, which is what Zeno denied.<a id='r881' /><a href='#f881' class='c014'><sup>[881]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span><a id='sec160'></a>160. The fragments of Zeno himself also show that
this was his line of argument. I give them according

<div class='sidenote'>The unit.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec161'></a>161. If we hold that the unit has no magnitude—and
this is required by what Aristotle calls the argument
from dichotomy,<a id='r886' /><a href='#f886' class='c014'><sup>[886]</sup></a>—then everything must be infinitely
small. Nothing made up of units without
magnitude can itself have any magnitude. On the
other hand, if we insist that the units of which things
are built up are something and not nothing, we must
hold that everything is infinitely great. The line is
infinitely divisible; and, according to this view, it will
be made up of an infinite number of units, each of
which has some magnitude.</p>

<p class='c002'>That this argument refers to points is proved by an
instructive passage from Aristotle’s <cite>Metaphysics</cite>.<a id='r887' /><a href='#f887' class='c014'><sup>[887]</sup></a> We
read there—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>If the unit is indivisible, it will, according to the proposition
of Zeno, be nothing. That which neither makes
anything larger by its addition to it, nor smaller by its subtraction
from it, is not, he says, a real thing at all; for clearly
what is real must be a magnitude. And, if it is a magnitude,
it is corporeal; for that is corporeal which is in every dimension.
The other things, <i>i.e.</i> the plane and the line, if added
in one way will make things larger, added in another they will
produce no effect; but the point and the unit cannot make
things larger in any way.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>From all this it seems impossible to draw any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>conclusion than that the “one” against which Zeno
argued was the “one” of which a number constitute a
“many,” and that is just the Pythagorean unit.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Space.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec162'></a>162. Aristotle refers to an argument which seems
to be directed against the Pythagorean doctrine of
space,<a id='r888' /><a href='#f888' class='c014'><sup>[888]</sup></a> and Simplicius quotes it in this form:<a id='r889' /><a href='#f889' class='c014'><sup>[889]</sup></a></p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>If there is space, it will be in something; for all that is is
in something, and what is in something is in space. So space
will be in space, and this goes on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad infinitum</i></span>, therefore there
is no space. R. P. 135.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>What Zeno is really arguing against here is the
attempt to distinguish space from the body that
occupies it. If we insist that body must be <em>in</em> space,
then we must go on to ask what space itself is in.
This is a “reinforcement” of the Parmenidean denial
of the void. Possibly the argument that everything
must be “in” something, or must have something
beyond it, had been used against the Parmenidean
theory of a finite sphere with nothing outside it.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Motion.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec163'></a>163. Zeno’s arguments on the subject of motion
have been preserved by Aristotle himself. The system
of Parmenides made all motion impossible, and his
successors had been driven to abandon the monistic
hypothesis in order to avoid this very consequence.
Zeno does not bring any fresh proofs of the impossibility
of motion; all he does is to show that a
pluralist theory, such as the Pythagorean, is just as
unable to explain it as was that of Parmenides.
Looked at in this way, Zeno’s arguments are no mere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>quibbles, but mark a great advance in the conception
of quantity. They are as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>(1) You cannot get to the end of a race-course.<a id='r890' /><a href='#f890' class='c014'><sup>[890]</sup></a> You
cannot traverse an infinite number of points in a finite time.
You must traverse the half of any given distance before you
traverse the whole, and the half of that again before you
can traverse it. This goes on <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>ad infinitum</i></span>, so that there
are an infinite number of points in any given space, and
you cannot touch an infinite number one by one in a finite
time.<a id='r891' /><a href='#f891' class='c014'><sup>[891]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>(2) Achilles will never overtake the tortoise. He must
first reach the place from which the tortoise started. By that
time the tortoise will have got some way ahead. Achilles must
then make up that, and again the tortoise will be ahead. He
is always coming nearer, but he never makes up to it.<a id='r892' /><a href='#f892' class='c014'><sup>[892]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>The “hypothesis” of the second argument is the
same as that in the first, namely, that the line is a
series of points; but the reasoning is complicated by
the introduction of another moving object. The
difference, accordingly, is not a half every time, but
diminishes in a constant ratio. Again, the first
argument shows that no moving object can ever
traverse any distance at all, however fast it may move;
the second emphasises the fact that, however slowly
it moves, it will traverse an infinite distance.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>(3) The arrow in flight is at rest. For, if everything is at
rest when it occupies a space equal to itself, and what is in
flight at any given moment always occupies a space equal to
itself, it cannot move.<a id='r893' /><a href='#f893' class='c014'><sup>[893]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>Here a further complication is introduced. The
moving object itself has length, and its successive
positions are not points but lines. The successive
moments in which it occupies them are still, however,
points of time. It may help to make this clear if we
remember that the flight of the arrow as represented
by the cinematograph would be exactly of this nature.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>(4) Half the time may be equal to double the time. Let
us suppose three rows of bodies,<a id='r894' /><a href='#f894' class='c014'><sup>[894]</sup></a> one of which (A) is at rest
while the other two (B, C) are moving with equal velocity in
opposite directions (Fig. 1). By the time they are all in the
same part of the course, B will have passed twice as many of
the bodies in C as in A (Fig. 2).</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>According to Aristotle, the paralogism here depends
upon the assumption that an equal magnitude moving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>with equal velocity must move for an equal time,
whether the magnitude with which it is equal is at
rest or in motion. That is certainly so, but we are
not to suppose that this assumption is Zeno’s own.
The fourth argument is, in fact, related to the third
just as the second is to the first. The Achilles adds
a second moving point to the single moving point of
the first argument; this argument adds a second
moving line to the single moving line of the arrow
in flight. The lines, however, are represented as a
series of units, which is just how the Pythagoreans
represented them; and it is quite true that, if lines are
a sum of discrete units, and time is similarly a series
of discrete moments, there is no other measure of
motion possible than the number of units which each
unit passes.</p>

<p class='c002'>This argument, like the others, is intended to bring
out the absurd conclusions which follow from the
assumption that all quantity is discrete, and what
Zeno has really done is to establish the conception of
continuous quantity by a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span> of the
other hypothesis. If we remember that Parmenides
had asserted the one to be continuous (fr. <a href='#Pa.8'>8</a>, 25), we
shall see how accurate is the account of Zeno’s method
which Plato puts into the mouth of Sokrates.</p>

<h3 class='c018'>II. <span class='sc'>Melissos of Samos</span></h3>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Life.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec164'></a>164. In his Life of Perikles, Plutarch tells us,
on the authority of Aristotle, that the philosopher
Melissos, son of Ithagenes, was the Samian general
who defeated the Athenian fleet in 441/0 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>:<a id='r896' /><a href='#f896' class='c014'><sup>[896]</sup></a> and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>was no doubt for this reason that Apollodoros fixed
his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>floruit</i></span> in Ol. LXXXIV. (444-41 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).<a id='r897' /><a href='#f897' class='c014'><sup>[897]</sup></a> Beyond
this, we really know nothing about his life. He is
said to have been, like Zeno, a disciple of Parmenides;<a id='r898' /><a href='#f898' class='c014'><sup>[898]</sup></a>
but, as he was a Samian, it is possible that he was
originally a member of the Ionic school, and we shall
see that certain features of his doctrine tend to bear
out this view. On the other hand, he was certainly
convinced by the Eleatic dialectic, and renounced the
Ionic doctrine in so far as it was inconsistent with
that. We note here the effect of the increased facility
of intercourse between East and West, which was
secured by the supremacy of Athens.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fragments.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec165'></a>165. The fragments which we have come from

real?<a id='r900' /><a href='#f900' class='c014'><sup>[900]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span><a id='Me.1'></a>(1) What was was ever, and ever shall be. For, if it had
come into being, it needs must have been nothing before it
came into being. Now, if it were nothing, in no wise could
anything have arisen out of nothing. R. P. 142.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Me.2'></a>(2) Since, then, it has not come into being, and since it
is, was ever, and ever shall be, it has no beginning or end,
but is without limit. For, if it had come into being, it would
have had a beginning (for it would have begun to come into
being at some time or other) and an end (for it would have
ceased to come into being at some time or other); but, if it
neither began nor ended, and ever was and ever shall be, it
has no beginning or end; for it is not possible for anything
to be ever without all being. R. P. 143.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Me.3'></a>(3) Further, just as it ever is, so it must ever be infinite in
magnitude. R. P. 143.</p>

<p class='c002'>(4) But nothing which has a beginning or end is either
eternal or infinite. R. P. 143.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Me.5'></a>(5) If it were not one, it would be bounded by something
else. R. P. 144 a.</p>

<p class='c002'>(6) For if it is (infinite), it must be one; for if it were
two, it could not be infinite; for then they would be bounded
by one another.<a id='r901' /><a href='#f901' class='c014'><sup>[901]</sup></a> R. P. 144.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Me.6a'></a>(6<i>a</i>) (And, since it is one, it is alike throughout; for if it
were unlike, it would be many and not one.)<a id='r902' /><a href='#f902' class='c014'><sup>[902]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Me.7'></a>(7) So then it is eternal and infinite and one and all alike.
And it cannot perish nor become greater, nor does it suffer pain
or grief. For, if any of these things happened to it, it would
no longer be one. For if it is altered, then the real must needs
not be all alike, but what was before must pass away, and what
was not must come into being. Now, if it changed by so
much as a single hair in ten thousand years, it would all
perish in the whole of time.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Further, it is not possible either that its order should be
changed; for the order which it had before does not perish,
nor does that which was not come into being. But, since
nothing is either added to it or passes away or is altered, how
can any real thing have had its order changed? For if anything
became different, that would amount to a change in its order.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nor does it suffer pain; for a thing in pain could not all
be. For a thing in pain could not be ever, nor has it the
same power as what is whole. Nor would it be alike, if it
were in pain; for it is only from the addition or subtraction of
something that it could feel pain, and then it would no longer
be alike. Nor could what is whole feel pain; for then what
was whole and what was real would pass away, and what was
not would come into being. And the same argument applies
to grief as to pain.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nor is anything empty. For what is empty is nothing.
What is nothing cannot be.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nor does it move; for it has nowhere to betake itself to, but
is full. For if there were aught empty, it would betake itself to
the empty. But, since there is naught empty, it has nowhere
to betake itself to.</p>

<p class='c002'>And it cannot be dense and rare; for it is not possible for
what is rare to be as full as what is dense, but what is rare is
at once emptier than what is dense.</p>

<p class='c002'>This is the way in which we must distinguish between what
is full and what is not full. If a thing has room for anything
else, and takes it in, it is not full; but if it has no room for
anything and does not take it in, it is full.</p>

<p class='c002'>Now, it must needs be full if there is naught empty, and if
it is full, it does not move. R. P. 145.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Me.8'></a>(8) This argument, then, is the greatest proof that it is one
alone; but the following are proofs of it also. If there were a
many, these would have to be of the same kind as I say that
the one is. For if there is earth and water, and air and iron,
and gold and fire, and if one thing is living and another dead,
and if things are black and white and all that men say they
really are,—if that is so, and if we see and hear aright, each
one of these must be such as we first decided, and they cannot
be changed or altered, but each must be just as it is. But, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>it is, we say that we see and hear and understand aright, and
yet we believe that what is warm becomes cold, and what is
cold warm; that what is hard turns soft, and what is soft
hard; that what is living dies, and that things are born from
what lives not; and that all those things are changed, and that
what they were and what they are now are in no way alike. We
think that iron, which is hard, is rubbed away by contact with
the finger;<a id='r903' /><a href='#f903' class='c014'><sup>[903]</sup></a> and so with gold and stone and everything which we
fancy to be strong, and that earth and stone are made out of
water; so that it turns out that we neither see nor know
realities. Now these things do not agree with one another.
We said that there were many things that were eternal and
had forms and strength of their own, and yet we fancy that
they all suffer alteration, and that they change from what we
see each time. It is clear, then, that we did not see aright
after all, nor are we right in believing that all these things are
many. They would not change if they were real, but each
thing would be just what we believed it to be; for nothing
is stronger than true reality. But if it has changed, what
was has passed away, and what was not is come into being.
So then, if there were many things, they would have to be
just of the same nature as the one. R. P. 147.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Me.9'></a>(9) Now, if it were to exist, it must needs be one; but
if it is one, it cannot have body; for, if it had body it would

<a href='#Me.1a'>1 <i>a</i></a>), and the arguments by which he supported this
view are those with which we are already familiar
(fr. <a href='#Me.1'>1</a>). Reality, as with Parmenides, is eternal, an
attribute which Melissos expressed in a way of his own.
He argued that since everything that has come into
being has a beginning and an end, everything that has
not come into being has no beginning or end. Aristotle
is very severe upon him for this simple conversion
of a universal affirmative proposition;<a id='r906' /><a href='#f906' class='c014'><sup>[906]</sup></a> but, of course,
his belief was not founded on that. His whole
conception of reality made it necessary for him to
regard it as eternal.<a id='r907' /><a href='#f907' class='c014'><sup>[907]</sup></a> It would be a more serious
matter if Aristotle were right in believing, as he
seems to have done,<a id='r908' /><a href='#f908' class='c014'><sup>[908]</sup></a> that Melissos inferred that
what is must be infinite in space, because it had
neither beginning nor end in time. This, however,
seems quite incredible. As we have the fragment
which Aristotle interprets in this way (fr. <a href='#Me.2'>2</a>), we are
quite entitled to understand it for ourselves, and I
cannot see anything to justify Aristotle’s assumption
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>that the expression “without limit” means without
limit in space.<a id='r909' /><a href='#f909' class='c014'><sup>[909]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Reality spatially infinite.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec167'></a>167. Melissos did indeed differ from Parmenides in
holding that reality was spatially as well as temporally
infinite; but he gave an excellent reason for this belief,
and had no need to support it by the extraordinary
argument just alluded to. What he said was that,
if it were limited, it would be limited by empty space.
This we know from Aristotle himself,<a id='r910' /><a href='#f910' class='c014'><sup>[910]</sup></a> and it marks a
real advance upon Parmenides. He had thought it
possible to regard reality as a finite sphere, but it
would have been difficult for him to work out this view
in detail. He would have had to say there was nothing
outside the sphere; but no one knew better than he
that there is no such thing as nothing. Melissos saw
that you cannot imagine a finite sphere without
regarding it as surrounded by an infinite empty space;<a id='r911' /><a href='#f911' class='c014'><sup>[911]</sup></a>
and as, in common with the rest of the school, he
denied the void (fr. <a href='#Me.7'>7</a>), he was forced to say reality was
spatially infinite (fr. <a href='#Me.3'>3</a>). It is possible that he was
influenced in this by his association with the Ionic
school.</p>

<p class='c002'>From the infinity of reality, it follows that it must
be one; for, if it were not one, it would be bounded by
something else (fr. <a href='#Me.5'>5</a>). And, being one, it must be
homogeneous throughout (fr. <a href='#Me.6a'>6<i>a</i></a>), for that is what we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>mean by one. Reality, then, is a single, homogeneous,
corporeal <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenum</i></span>, stretching out to infinity in space, and
going backwards and forwards to infinity in time.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opposition to Ionians.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec168'></a>168. Eleaticism was always critical, and we are not
without indications of the attitude taken up by Melissos
towards contemporary systems. The flaw which he
found in the Ionian theories was that they all assumed
some want of homogeneity in the One, which is a real
inconsistency. Further, they all allowed the possibility
of change; but, if all things are one, change must be a
form of coming into being and passing away. If you
admit that a thing can change, you cannot maintain
that it is eternal. Nor can the arrangement of the
parts of reality alter, as Anaximander, for instance,
had held; any such change necessarily involves a
coming into being and passing away.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next point made by Melissos is somewhat
peculiar. Reality, he says, cannot feel sorrow or pain;
for that is always due to the addition or subtraction of
something, which is impossible. It is not easy to be
sure what this refers to. Perhaps it is to the theory of
Herakleitos with its Want and Surfeit, perhaps to something
of which no record has been preserved.</p>

<p class='c002'>Motion in general<a id='r912' /><a href='#f912' class='c014'><sup>[912]</sup></a> and rarefaction and condensation
in particular are impossible; for both imply the existence
of empty space. Divisibility is excluded for the
same reason. These are the same arguments as
Parmenides employed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opposition to Pythagoreans.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span><a id='sec169'></a>169. In nearly all accounts of the system of
Melissos, we find it stated that he denied the
corporeality of what is real,—an opinion which is
supported by a reference to fr. <a href='#Me.9'>9</a>, which is certainly
quoted by Simplicius to prove this very point.<a id='r913' /><a href='#f913' class='c014'><sup>[913]</sup></a> If,
however, our general view as to the character of early
Greek Philosophy is correct, the statement must seem
incredible. And it will seem even more surprising
when we find that in the <cite>Metaphysics</cite> Aristotle says
that, while the unity of Parmenides seemed to be ideal,
that of Melissos was material.<a id='r914' /><a href='#f914' class='c014'><sup>[914]</sup></a> Now the fragment, as
it stands in the MSS. of Simplicius,<a id='r915' /><a href='#f915' class='c014'><sup>[915]</sup></a> puts a purely
hypothetical case, and would most naturally be understood
as a disproof of the existence of something on
the ground that, if it existed, it would have to be both
corporeal and one. This cannot refer to the Eleatic
One, in which Melissos himself believed; and, as the
argument is almost verbally the same as one of
Zeno’s,<a id='r916' /><a href='#f916' class='c014'><sup>[916]</sup></a> it is natural to suppose that it also was
directed against the Pythagorean assumption of ultimate
units. The only possible objection is that Simplicius,
who twice quotes the fragment, certainly took
it in the sense usually given to it.<a id='r917' /><a href='#f917' class='c014'><sup>[917]</sup></a> But it was very
natural for him to make this mistake. “The One”
was an expression that had two senses in the middle
of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; it meant either the whole of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>reality or the point as a spatial unit. To maintain it
in the first sense, the Eleatics were obliged to disprove
it in the second; and so it sometimes seemed that they
were speaking of their own “One” when they really
meant the other. We have seen that the very same
difficulty was felt about Zeno’s denial of the “one.”<a id='r918' /><a href='#f918' class='c014'><sup>[918]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Opposition to Anaxagoras.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec170'></a>170. The most remarkable fragment of Melissos is,
perhaps, the last (fr. <a href='#Me.8'>8</a>). It seems to be directed
against Anaxagoras; at least the language used seems
more applicable to him than to any one else. Anaxagoras
had admitted (<a href='#sec137'>§ 137</a>, <i>fin.</i>) that, so far as our perceptions
go, they do not entirely agree with his theory,
though he held this was due solely to their weakness.
Melissos, taking advantage of this admission, urges
that, if we give up the senses as the ultimate test of
reality, we are not entitled to reject the Eleatic theory.
With wonderful penetration he points out that if we
are to say, with Anaxagoras, that things are a many,
we are bound also to say that each one of them is such
as the Eleatics declared the One to be. In other
words, the only consistent pluralism is the atomic
theory.</p>

<p class='c002'>Melissos has long been unduly depreciated owing to
the criticisms of Aristotle; but these, we have seen, are
based mainly on a somewhat pedantic objection to the
false conversion in the early part of the argument.
Melissos knew nothing about the rules of conversion;
and if he had, he could easily have made his reasoning
formally correct without modifying his system. His
greatness consisted in this, that not only was he the
real systematiser of Eleaticism, but he was also able to
see, before the pluralists saw it themselves, the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>way in which the theory that things are a many could
be consistently worked out.<a id='r919' /><a href='#f919' class='c014'><sup>[919]</sup></a> It is significant that
Polybos, the nephew of Hippokrates, reproaches those
“sophists” who taught there was only one primary
substance with “putting the doctrine of Melissos on
its feet.”<a id='r920' /><a href='#f920' class='c014'><sup>[920]</sup></a></p>

word does not mean the assumption of something as a foundation, but the
setting before one’s self of a statement as a problem to be solved (Ionic
ὑποθέσθαι, Attic προθέσθαι). If the conclusions which necessarily follow
from the ὑπόθεσις (τὰ συμβαίνοντα) are impossible, the ὑπόθεσις is
“destroyed” (cf. Plato, <cite>Rep.</cite> 533 c 8, τὰς ὑποθέσεις ἀναιροῦσα). The

plainly stated by Aristotle (<i>loc. cit.</i>), συμβαίνειν οἴεται ἴσον εἶναι χρόνον

as frs. 1-5 of Melissos, as it has been proved by A. Pabst that they are
merely a paraphrase of the genuine fragments (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De Melissi Samii fragmentis</cite></span>,
Bonn, 1889). Almost simultaneously I had independently come to the
same conclusion (see the first edition, § 138). Zeller and Diels have both

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX <br /> LEUKIPPOS OF MILETOS</h2>
</div>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Leukippos and Demokritos.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec171'></a>171. We have seen (§§ 31, 122) that the school of
Miletos did not come to an end with Anaximenes, and
it is a striking fact that the man who gave the most
complete answer to the question first asked by Thales
was a Milesian.<a id='r921' /><a href='#f921' class='c014'><sup>[921]</sup></a> It is true that the very existence of
Leukippos has been called in question. Epicurus said
there never was such a philosopher, and the same thing
has been maintained in quite recent times.<a id='r922' /><a href='#f922' class='c014'><sup>[922]</sup></a> On the
other hand, Aristotle and Theophrastos certainly made
him the originator of the atomic theory, and it still
seems possible to show they were right. Incidentally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>we shall see how later writers came to ignore him, and
thus made possible the sally of Epicurus.</p>

<p class='c002'>The question is intimately bound up with that of
the date of Demokritos, who said that he was a young
man in the old age of Anaxagoras, a statement which
makes it unlikely that he founded his school at Abdera
before 420 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, the date given by Apollodoros for his
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>floruit</i></span>.<a id='r923' /><a href='#f923' class='c014'><sup>[923]</sup></a> Now Theophrastos stated that Diogenes of
Apollonia borrowed some of his views from Anaxagoras
and some from Leukippos,<a id='r924' /><a href='#f924' class='c014'><sup>[924]</sup></a> which can only mean that
there were traces of the atomic theory in his work.
Further, Apollonios is parodied in the <cite>Clouds</cite> of
Aristophanes, which was produced in 423 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, from
which it follows that the work of Leukippos must have
become known considerably before that date. What
that work was, Theophrastos also tells us. It was the
<cite>Great Diakosmos</cite> usually attributed to Demokritos.<a id='r925' /><a href='#f925' class='c014'><sup>[925]</sup></a>
This means further that what were known later as the
works of Demokritos were really the writings of the
school of Abdera, and included, as was natural, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>works of its founder. They formed, in fact, a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>corpus</i></span>
comparable to that which has come down to us under
the name of Hippokrates, and it was no more possible
to distinguish the authors of the different treatises in
the one case than it is in the other. We need not
hesitate, for all that, to believe that Aristotle and
Theophrastos were better informed on this point than
later writers, who naturally regarded the whole mass as
equally the work of Demokritos.</p>

<p class='c002'>Theophrastos found Leukippos described as an
Eleate in some of his authorities, and, if we may trust
analogy, that means he had settled at Elea.<a id='r926' /><a href='#f926' class='c014'><sup>[926]</sup></a> It is
possible that his emigration to the west was connected
with the revolution at Miletos in 450-49 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span><a id='r927' /><a href='#f927' class='c014'><sup>[927]</sup></a> In
any case, Theophrastos says distinctly that he had
been a member of the school of Parmenides, and the
way in which he speaks suggests that the founder of
that school was still at its head.<a id='r928' /><a href='#f928' class='c014'><sup>[928]</sup></a> He may very
well have been so, if we accept Plato’s chronology.<a id='r929' /><a href='#f929' class='c014'><sup>[929]</sup></a>
Theophrastos also appears to have said that Leukippos
“heard” Zeno, which is very credible. We shall see,
at any rate, that the influence of Zeno on his thinking
is unmistakable.<a id='r930' /><a href='#f930' class='c014'><sup>[930]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>The relations of Leukippos to Empedokles and
Anaxagoras are more difficult to determine. It has
become part of the case for the historical reality of
Leukippos that there are traces of atomism in the
systems of these men; but the case is strong enough
without that assumption. Besides, it lands us in
serious difficulties, not the least of which is that it
would require us to regard Empedokles and Anaxagoras
as mere eclectics like Diogenes of Apollonia.<a id='r931' /><a href='#f931' class='c014'><sup>[931]</sup></a> The
strongest argument for the view that Leukippos
influenced Empedokles is that drawn from the doctrine
of “pores”; but we have seen that this originated
with Alkmaion, and it is therefore more probable that
Leukippos derived it from Empedokles.<a id='r932' /><a href='#f932' class='c014'><sup>[932]</sup></a> We have
seen too that Zeno probably wrote against Empedokles,
and we know that he influenced Leukippos.<a id='r933' /><a href='#f933' class='c014'><sup>[933]</sup></a> Nor, is
it at all probable that Anaxagoras knew anything of
the theory of Leukippos. It is true that he denied
the existence of the void; but it does not follow that
any one had already maintained that doctrine in the
atomist sense. The early Pythagoreans had spoken
of a void too, though they had confused it with
atmospheric air; and the experiments of Anaxagoras
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>with the <em>klepsydra</em> and the inflated skins would only
have had any point if they were directed against the
Pythagorean theory.<a id='r934' /><a href='#f934' class='c014'><sup>[934]</sup></a> If he had really wished to
refute Leukippos, he would have had to use arguments
of a very different kind.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Theophrastos on the atomic theory.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec172'></a>172. Theophrastos wrote of Leukippos as follows
in the First Book of his <cite>Opinions</cite>:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Leukippos of Elea or Miletos (for both accounts are given
of him) had associated with Parmenides in philosophy. He
did not, however, follow the same path in his explanation of
things as Parmenides and Xenophanes did, but, as is believed,
the very opposite (R. P. 185). They made the All one,
immovable, uncreated, and finite, and did not even permit us
to search for <em>what is not</em>; he assumed innumerable and ever-moving
elements, namely, the atoms. And he made their
forms infinite in number, since there was no reason why they
should be of one kind rather than another, and because he
saw that there was unceasing becoming and change in things.
He held, further, that <em>what is</em> is no more real than <em>what is
not</em>, and that both are alike causes of the things that come
into being; for he laid down that the substance of the atoms
was compact and full, and he called them <em>what is</em>, while they
moved in the void which he called <em>what is not</em>, but affirmed
to be just as real as <em>what is</em>. R. P. 194.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Leukippos and the Eleatics.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec173'></a>173. It will be observed that Theophrastos, while
noting the affiliation of Leukippos to the Eleatic school,
points out that his theory is, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>prima facie</i></span>,<a id='r935' /><a href='#f935' class='c014'><sup>[935]</sup></a> just the
opposite of that maintained by Parmenides. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>have been led by this to deny the Eleaticism of
Leukippos altogether; but this denial is really based
on the view that the system of Parmenides was
“metaphysical,” coupled with a great reluctance to
admit that so scientific a hypothesis as the atomic
theory can have had a “metaphysical” origin. It is
really due to prejudice, and we must not suppose
Theophrastos himself believed the two theories to be
so far apart as they seem.<a id='r936' /><a href='#f936' class='c014'><sup>[936]</sup></a> As this is really the most
important point in the history of early Greek philosophy,
and as, rightly understood, it furnishes the key to the
whole development, it is worth while to transcribe a
passage of Aristotle<a id='r937' /><a href='#f937' class='c014'><sup>[937]</sup></a> which explains the historical
connexion in a way that leaves nothing to be desired.</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Leukippos and Demokritos have decided about all things
practically by the same method and on the same theory,
taking as their starting-point what naturally comes first. Some
of the ancients had held that the real must necessarily be
one and immovable; for, said they, empty space is not
real, and motion would be impossible without empty space
separated from matter; nor, further, could reality be a many,
if there were nothing to separate things. And it makes no
difference if any one holds that the All is not continuous, but
discrete, with its parts in contact (<em>the Pythagorean view</em>),
instead of holding that reality is many, not one, and that
there is empty space. For, if it is divisible at every point
there is no one, and therefore no many, and the Whole is
empty (<cite>Zeno</cite>); while, if we say it is divisible in one place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>and not in another, this looks like an arbitrary fiction; for
up to what point and for what reason will part of the Whole
be in this state and be full, while the rest is discrete? And,
on the same grounds, they further say that there can be no
motion. In consequence of these reasonings, then, going
beyond perception and overlooking it in the belief that we
ought to follow the argument, they say that the All is one
and immovable (<em>Parmenides</em>), and some of them that it is
infinite (<em>Melissos</em>), for any limit would be bounded by empty
space. This, then, is the opinion they expressed about the
truth, and these are the reasons which led them to do so.
Now, so far as arguments go, this conclusion does seem to
follow; but, if we appeal to facts, to hold such a view looks
like madness. No one who is mad is so far out of his
senses that fire and ice appear to him to be one; it is only
things that are right, and things that appear right from habit,
in which madness makes some people see no difference.</p>

<p class='c002'>Leukippos, however, thought he had a theory which was
in harmony with sense-perception, and did not do away with
coming into being and passing away, nor motion, nor the
multiplicity of things. He made this concession to experience,
while he conceded, on the other hand, to those who invented
the One that motion was impossible without the void, that
the void was not real, and that nothing of what was real was
not real. “For,” said he, “that which is strictly speaking
real is an absolute <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenum</i></span>; but the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>plenum</i></span> is not one. On
the contrary, there are an infinite number of them, and they
are invisible owing to the smallness of their bulk. They
move in the void (for there is a void); and by their coming
together they effect coming into being; by their separation,
passing away.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>It is true that in this passage Zeno and Melissos
are not named, but the reference to them is unmistakable.
The argument of Zeno against the Pythagoreans
is clearly given; and Melissos was the only Eleatic who
made reality infinite, a point which is distinctly mentioned.
We are therefore justified by Aristotle’s words
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>in explaining the genesis of Atomism and its relation
to Eleaticism as follows. Zeno had shown that all
pluralist systems yet known, and especially Pythagoreanism,
were unable to stand before the arguments
from infinite divisibility which he adduced. Melissos
had used the same argument against Anaxagoras, and
had added, by way of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></span>, that, if
there were many things, each one of them must be
such as the Eleatics held the One to be. To this
Leukippos answers, “Why not?” He admitted the
force of Zeno’s arguments by setting a limit to
divisibility, and to each of the atoms which he thus
arrived at he ascribed all the predicates of the Eleatic
One; for Parmenides had shown that if <em>it is</em>, it must
have these predicates somehow. The same view is
implied in a passage of Aristotle’s <cite>Physics</cite>.<a id='r938' /><a href='#f938' class='c014'><sup>[938]</sup></a> “Some,”
we are there told, “surrendered to both arguments, to the
first, the argument that all things are one, if the word
<em>is</em> is used in one sense only (<em>Parmenides</em>), by affirming
the reality of what is not; to the second, that based
on dichotomy (<em>Zeno</em>), by introducing indivisible magnitudes.”
Finally, it is only by regarding the matter in
this way that we can attach any meaning to another
statement of Aristotle’s to the effect that Leukippos
and Demokritos, as well as the Pythagoreans, virtually
make all things out of numbers.<a id='r939' /><a href='#f939' class='c014'><sup>[939]</sup></a> Leukippos, in fact,
gave the Pythagorean monads the character of the
Parmenidean One.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Atoms.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec174'></a>174. We must observe that the atom is not mathematically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>indivisible, for it has magnitude; it is,
however, physically indivisible, because, like the One
of Parmenides, it contains in it no empty space.<a id='r940' /><a href='#f940' class='c014'><sup>[940]</sup></a> Each
atom has extension, and all the atoms are exactly
alike in substance.<a id='r941' /><a href='#f941' class='c014'><sup>[941]</sup></a> Therefore all differences in things
must be accounted for either by the shape of the atoms
or by their arrangement. It seems probable that the
three ways in which differences arise, namely, shape,
position, and arrangement, were already distinguished
by Leukippos; for Aristotle mentions his name in
connexion with them.<a id='r942' /><a href='#f942' class='c014'><sup>[942]</sup></a> This explains, too, why the
atoms are called “forms” or “figures,” a way of
speaking which seems to be of Pythagorean origin.<a id='r943' /><a href='#f943' class='c014'><sup>[943]</sup></a>
That they are also called φύσις<a id='r944' /><a href='#f944' class='c014'><sup>[944]</sup></a> is quite intelligible
if we remember what was said of that word in
the Introduction (<a href='#In.7'>§ VII</a>.). The differences in shape,
order, and position just referred to account for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>“opposites,” the “elements” being regarded rather as
aggregates of these (πανσπερμίαι), as by Anaxagoras.<a id='r945' /><a href='#f945' class='c014'><sup>[945]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The void.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec175'></a>175. Leukippos affirmed the existence both of the
Full and the Empty, terms which he may have
borrowed from Melissos.<a id='r946' /><a href='#f946' class='c014'><sup>[946]</sup></a> As we have seen, he had
to assume the existence of empty space, which the
Eleatics had denied, in order to make his explanation
of the nature of body possible. Here again he is
developing a Pythagorean view. The Pythagoreans
had spoken of the void, which kept the units apart;
but they had not distinguished it from atmospheric
air (<a href='#sec53'>§ 53</a>), which Empedokles had shown to be a
corporeal substance (<a href='#sec107'>§ 107</a>). Parmenides, indeed, had
formed a clearer conception of space, but only to
deny its reality. Leukippos started from this. He
admitted, indeed, that space was not real, that is to
say, corporeal; but he maintained that it existed all
the same. He hardly, it is true, had words to express
his discovery in; for the verb “to be” had hitherto
been used by philosophers only of body. But he did
his best to make his meaning clear by saying that
“what is not” (in the old corporealist sense) “is” (in
another sense) just as much as “what is.” The void
is as real as body.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is a curious fact that the Atomists, who are
commonly regarded as the great materialists of
antiquity, were actually the first to say distinctly that
a thing might be real without being a body.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cosmology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec176'></a>176. It might seem a hopeless task to disentangle
the cosmology of Leukippos from that of Demokritos,
with which it is generally identified; but that very fact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>affords an invaluable clue. So far as we know, no one
after Theophrastos was able to distinguish the doctrines
of the two men, and it follows from this that all definite
statements about Leukippos in later writers must, in
the long run, go back to him. If we follow this up,
we shall be able to give a fairly clear account of the
system, and we shall even come across some views
which are peculiar to Leukippos and were not adopted
by Demokritos.<a id='r947' /><a href='#f947' class='c014'><sup>[947]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>We shall start from the fuller of the two doxographies
in Diogenes, which comes from an epitome of
Theophrastos.<a id='r948' /><a href='#f948' class='c014'><sup>[948]</sup></a> It is as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>He says that the All is infinite, and that it is part full, and
part empty. These (the full and the empty), he says, are the
elements. From them arise innumerable worlds and are
resolved into them. The worlds come into being thus.
There were borne along by “abscision from the infinite”
many bodies of all sorts of figures “into a mighty void,” and
they being gathered together produce a single vortex. In it,
as they came into collision with one another and were whirled
round in all manner of ways, those which were alike were
separated apart and came to their likes. But, as they were
no longer able to revolve in equilibrium owing to their
multitude, those of them that were fine went out to the
external void, as if passed through a sieve; the rest stayed
together, and becoming entangled with one another, ran
down together, and made a first spherical structure. This
was in substance like a membrane or skin containing in itself
all kinds of bodies. And, as these bodies were borne round in
a vortex, in virtue of the resistance of the middle, the surrounding
membrane became thin, as the contiguous bodies kept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>flowing together from contact with the vortex. And in this
way the earth came into being, those things which had been
borne towards the middle abiding there. Moreover, the
containing membrane was increased by the further separating
out of bodies from outside; and, being itself carried round in
a vortex, it further got possession of all with which it had
come in contact. Some of these becoming entangled, produce
a structure, which was at first moist and muddy; but, when
they had been dried and were revolving along with the vortex
of the whole, they were then ignited and produced the substance
of the heavenly bodies. The circle of the sun is the
outermost, that of the moon is nearest to the earth, and those
of the others are between these. And all the heavenly bodies
are ignited because of the swiftness of their motion; while
the sun is also ignited by the stars. But the moon only
receives a small portion of fire. The sun and the moon are
eclipsed.... (And the obliquity of the zodiac is produced)
by the earth being inclined towards the south; and the
northern parts of it have constant snow and are cold and
frozen. And the sun is eclipsed rarely, and the moon continually,
because their circles are unequal. And just as there
are comings into being of the world, so there are growths and
decays and passings away in virtue of a certain necessity, of
the nature of which he gives no clear account.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>As it comes substantially from Theophrastos, this
passage is to be regarded as good evidence for the
cosmology of Leukippos, and it is confirmed in an
interesting way by certain Epicurean extracts from
the <cite>Great Diakosmos</cite>.<a id='r949' /><a href='#f949' class='c014'><sup>[949]</sup></a> These, however, as is natural,
give a specially Epicurean turn to some of the
doctrines, and must therefore be used with caution.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Relation to Ionic cosmology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec177'></a>177. The general impression which we get from
the cosmology of Leukippos is that he either ignored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>or had never heard of the great advance in the general
view of the world which was due to the later Pythagoreans.
He is as reactionary in his detailed cosmology
as he was daring in his general physical theory.
We seem to be reading once more of the speculations
of Anaximenes or even of Anaximander, though there
are traces of Empedokles and Anaxagoras too. The
explanation is not hard to see. Leukippos would not
learn a cosmology from his Eleatic teachers; and, even
when he found it possible to construct one without
giving up the Parmenidean view of reality, he was
necessarily thrown back upon the older systems of
Ionia. The result was unfortunate. The astronomy
of Demokritos, so far as we know it, was still of this
childish character. There is no reason to doubt the
statement of Seneca that he did not venture to say
how many planets there were.<a id='r950' /><a href='#f950' class='c014'><sup>[950]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>This, I take it, is what gives plausibility to Gomperz’s
statement that Atomism was “the ripe fruit on the tree
of the old Ionic doctrine of matter which had been
tended by the Ionian physiologists.”<a id='r951' /><a href='#f951' class='c014'><sup>[951]</sup></a> The detailed
cosmology was certainly such a fruit, and it was
possibly over-ripe; but the atomic theory proper, in
which the real greatness of Leukippos comes out, was
wholly Eleatic in its origin. Nevertheless, it will repay
us to examine the cosmology too; for such an examination
will serve better than anything else to bring out
the true nature of the historical development of which
it was the outcome.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The eternal motion.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec178'></a>178. Leukippos represented the atoms as having
been always in motion. Aristotle puts this in his own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>way. The atomists, he says, “indolently” left it unexplained
what was the source of motion, and they
did not say what sort of motion it was. In other
words, they did not decide whether it was a “natural
motion” or one impressed on them “contrary to their
nature.”<a id='r952' /><a href='#f952' class='c014'><sup>[952]</sup></a> He even went so far as to say that they
made it “spontaneous,” a remark which has given rise
to the erroneous view that they held it was due to
chance.<a id='r953' /><a href='#f953' class='c014'><sup>[953]</sup></a> Aristotle does not say that, however; but
only that the atomists did not explain the motion of
the atoms in any of the ways in which he himself
explained the motion of the elements. They neither
ascribed to them a natural motion like the circular
motion of the heavens and the rectilinear motion of
the four elements in the sublunary region, nor did they
give them a forced motion contrary to their own nature,
like the upward motion which may be given to the
heavy elements and the downward which may be
given to the light. The only fragment of Leukippos
which has survived is an express denial of chance.
“Naught happens for nothing,” he said “but everything
from a ground and of necessity.”<a id='r954' /><a href='#f954' class='c014'><sup>[954]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>If we put the matter historically, all this means that
Leukippos did not, like Empedokles and Anaxagoras,
find it necessary to assume a force to originate motion.
He had no need of Love and Strife or Mind, and the
reason is clear. Though Empedokles and Anaxagoras
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>had tried to explain multiplicity and motion, they had
not broken so radically as Leukippos did with the
Parmenidean One. Both of them started with a condition
of matter in which the “roots” or “seeds” were
mixed so as to be “all together,” and they therefore
required something to break up this unity. Leukippos,
who started with an infinite number of Parmenidean
“Ones,” so to speak, required no external agency to
separate them. What he had to do was just the
opposite. He had to give an explanation of their
coming together, and there was nothing so far to
prevent his return to the old and natural idea that
motion does not require any explanation at all.<a id='r955' /><a href='#f955' class='c014'><sup>[955]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>This, then, is what seems to follow from the
criticisms of Aristotle and from the nature of the
case; but it will be observed that it is not consistent
with Zeller’s opinion that the original motion of the
atoms is a fall through infinite space, as in the system
of Epicurus. Zeller’s view depends, of course, on the
further belief that the atoms have weight, and that
weight is the tendency of bodies to fall, so we must
go on to consider whether and in what sense weight
is a property of the atoms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The weight of the atoms.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec179'></a>179. As is well known, Epicurus held that the
atoms were naturally heavy, and therefore fell continually
in the infinite void. The school tradition is,
however, that the “natural weight” of the atoms was
an addition made by Epicurus himself to the original
atomic system. Demokritos, we are told, assigned two
properties to atoms, magnitude and form, to which
Epicurus added a third, weight.<a id='r956' /><a href='#f956' class='c014'><sup>[956]</sup></a> On the other hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>Aristotle distinctly says in one place that Demokritos
held the atoms were heavier “in proportion to their
excess,” and this seems to be explained by the statement
of Theophrastos that, according to him, weight
depended on magnitude.<a id='r957' /><a href='#f957' class='c014'><sup>[957]</sup></a> It will be observed that,
even so, it is not represented as a primary property of
the atoms in the same sense as magnitude.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is impossible to solve this apparent contradiction
without referring briefly to the history of Greek ideas
about weight. It is clear that lightness and weight
would be among the very first properties of body to
be distinctly recognised as such. The necessity of
lifting burdens must very soon have led men to
distinguish them, though no doubt in some primitive
and more or less animistic form. Both weight and
lightness would be thought of as <em>things</em> that were <em>in</em>
bodies. Now it is a remarkable feature of early Greek
philosophy that from the first it was able to shake
itself free from this idea. Weight is never spoken of
as a “thing” as, for instance, warmth and cold are;
and, so far as we can see, not one of the thinkers we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>have studied hitherto thought it necessary to give any
explanation of it at all, or even to say anything about
it.<a id='r958' /><a href='#f958' class='c014'><sup>[958]</sup></a> The motions and resistances which popular theory
ascribes to weight are all explained in some other way.
Aristotle distinctly declares that none of his predecessors
had said anything of absolute weight and
lightness. They had only treated of the relatively
light and heavy.<a id='r959' /><a href='#f959' class='c014'><sup>[959]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>This way of regarding the popular notions of weight
and lightness is clearly formulated for the first time in
Plato’s <cite>Timaeus</cite>.<a id='r960' /><a href='#f960' class='c014'><sup>[960]</sup></a> There is no such thing in the world,
we are told there, as “up” or “down.” The middle of
the world is not “down” but “just in the middle,” and
there is no reason why any point in the circumference
should be said to be “above” or “below” another. It
is really the tendency of bodies towards their kin that
makes us call a falling body heavy and the place to
which it falls “below.” Here Plato is really giving the
view which was taken more or less consciously by his
predecessors, and it is not till the time of Aristotle that
it is questioned.<a id='r961' /><a href='#f961' class='c014'><sup>[961]</sup></a> For reasons which do not concern
us here, he definitely identified the circumference of
the heavens with “up” and the middle of the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>with “down,” and equipped the four elements with
natural weight and lightness that they might perform
their rectilinear motions between them. As, however,
Aristotle believed there was only one world, and as he
did not ascribe weight to the heavens proper, the effect
of this reactionary theory upon his cosmical system
was not great; it was only when Epicurus tried to
combine it with the infinite void that its true character
emerged. It seems to me that the nightmare of
Epicurean atomism can only be explained on the
assumption that an Aristotelian doctrine was violently
adapted to a theory which really excluded it.<a id='r962' /><a href='#f962' class='c014'><sup>[962]</sup></a> It is
totally unlike anything we meet with in earlier days.</p>

<p class='c002'>This brief historical survey suggests at once that it
is only in the vortex that the atoms acquire weight
and lightness,<a id='r963' /><a href='#f963' class='c014'><sup>[963]</sup></a> which are, after all, only popular names
for facts which can be further analysed. We are told
that Leukippos held that one effect of the vortex was
that like atoms were brought together with their likes.<a id='r964' /><a href='#f964' class='c014'><sup>[964]</sup></a>
In this way of speaking we seem to see the influence
of Empedokles, though the “likeness” is of another
kind. It is the finer atoms that are forced to the
circumference, while the larger tend to the centre. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>may express that by saying that the larger are heavy
and the smaller light, and this will amply account for
everything Aristotle and Theophrastos say; for there
is no passage where the atoms outside the vortex are
distinctly said to be heavy or light.<a id='r965' /><a href='#f965' class='c014'><sup>[965]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>There is a striking confirmation of the view just
given in the atomist cosmology quoted above.<a id='r966' /><a href='#f966' class='c014'><sup>[966]</sup></a> We
are told there that the separation of the larger and
smaller atoms was due to the fact that they were “no
longer able to revolve in equilibrium owing to their
number,” which implies that they had previously been
in a state of “equilibrium” or “equipoise.” Now the
word ἰσορροπία has no necessary implication of weight
in Greek. A ῥοπή is a mere leaning or inclination in
a certain direction, which may be caused by weight or
anything else. The state of ἰσορροπία is therefore
that in which the tendency in one direction is exactly
equal to the tendency in any other, and such a state
is more naturally described as the absence of weight
than as the presence of opposite weights neutralising
one another. That way of looking at it may be useful
from the point of view of later science, but it is not safe
to attribute it to the thinkers of the fifth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span></p>

<p class='c002'>If we no longer regard the “eternal motion” of the
premundane and extramundane atoms as due to their
weight, there is no reason for describing it as a fall.
None of our authorities do as a matter of fact so describe
it, nor do they tell us in any way what it was. It is
safest to say that it is simply a confused motion this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>way and that.<a id='r967' /><a href='#f967' class='c014'><sup>[967]</sup></a> It is possible that the comparison of
the motion of the atoms of the soul to that of the
motes in a sunbeam coming through a window, which
Aristotle attributes to Demokritos,<a id='r968' /><a href='#f968' class='c014'><sup>[968]</sup></a> is really intended
as an illustration of the original motion of the atoms
still surviving in the soul. The fact that it is also a
Pythagorean comparison<a id='r969' /><a href='#f969' class='c014'><sup>[969]</sup></a> in no way tells against this;
for we have seen that there is a real connexion
between the Pythagorean monads and the atoms. It is
also significant that the point of the comparison appears
to have been the fact that the motes in the sunbeam
move even when there is no wind, so that it would be
a very apt illustration indeed of the motion inherent in
the atoms apart from the secondary motions produced by
impact and collision. That, however, is problematical;
it only serves to suggest the sort of motion which it
is natural to suppose that Leukippos gave his atoms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The vortex.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec180'></a>180. But what are we to say of the vortex itself
which produces these effects? Gomperz observes that
they seem to be “the precise contrary of what they
should have been by the laws of physics”; for, “as
every centrifugal machine would show, it is the heaviest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>substances which are hurled to the greatest distance.”<a id='r970' /><a href='#f970' class='c014'><sup>[970]</sup></a>
Are we to suppose that Leukippos was ignorant of this
fact, which was known to Anaxagoras, though Gomperz
is wrong in supposing there is any reason to believe
that Anaximander took account of it?<a id='r971' /><a href='#f971' class='c014'><sup>[971]</sup></a> Now we
know from Aristotle that all those who accounted for
the earth being in the centre of the world by means
of a vortex appealed to the analogy of eddies in wind
or water,<a id='r972' /><a href='#f972' class='c014'><sup>[972]</sup></a> and Gomperz supposes that the whole theory
was an erroneous generalisation of this observation. If
we look at the matter more closely, we can see, I think,
that there is no error at all.</p>

<p class='c002'>We must remember that all the parts of the vortex
are in contact, and that it is just this contact (ἐπίψαυσις)
by which the motion of the outermost parts is communicated
to those within them. The larger bodies
are more able to resist this communicated motion than
the smaller, and in this way they make their way to
the centre where the motion is least, and force the
smaller bodies out. This resistance is surely just the
ἀντέρεισις τοῦ μέσου which is mentioned in the doxography
of Leukippos,<a id='r973' /><a href='#f973' class='c014'><sup>[973]</sup></a> and it is quite in accordance
with this that, on the atomist theory, the nearer a
heavenly body is to the centre, the slower is its
revolution.<a id='r974' /><a href='#f974' class='c014'><sup>[974]</sup></a> There is no question of “centrifugal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>force” at all, and the analogy of eddies in air and
water is quite satisfactory.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The earth and the heavenly bodies.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec181'></a>181. When we come to details, the reactionary
character of the atomist cosmology is very manifest.
The earth was shaped like a tambourine, and floated
on the air.<a id='r975' /><a href='#f975' class='c014'><sup>[975]</sup></a> It was inclined towards the south because
the heat of that region made the air thinner, while the
ice and cold of the north made it denser and more
able to support the earth.<a id='r976' /><a href='#f976' class='c014'><sup>[976]</sup></a> This accounts for the
obliquity of the zodiac. Like Anaximander (<a href='#sec19'>§ 19</a>),
Leukippos held that the sun was further away than the
stars, though he also held that these were further
away than the moon.<a id='r977' /><a href='#f977' class='c014'><sup>[977]</sup></a> This certainly suggests that he
made no clear distinction between the planets and the
fixed stars. He does, however, appear to have known
the theory of eclipses as given by Anaxagoras.<a id='r978' /><a href='#f978' class='c014'><sup>[978]</sup></a>
Such other pieces of information as have come down
to us are mainly of interest as showing that, in some
important respects, the doctrine of Leukippos was not
the same as that taught afterwards by Demokritos.<a id='r979' /><a href='#f979' class='c014'><sup>[979]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Perception.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec182'></a>182. Aetios expressly attributes to Leukippos the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>doctrine that the objects of sense-perception exist “by
law” and not by nature.<a id='r980' /><a href='#f980' class='c014'><sup>[980]</sup></a> This must come from
Theophrastos; for, as we have seen, all later writers
quote Demokritos only. A further proof of the
correctness of the statement is that we also find
it attributed to Diogenes of Apollonia, who, as
Theophrastos tells us, derived some of his views from
Leukippos. There is nothing surprising in this.
Parmenides had already declared the senses to be
deceitful, and said that colour and the like were only
“names,”<a id='r981' /><a href='#f981' class='c014'><sup>[981]</sup></a> and Empedokles had also spoken of coming
into being and passing away as only “names.”<a id='r982' /><a href='#f982' class='c014'><sup>[982]</sup></a> It
is not likely that Leukippos went much further than
this. It would probably be wrong to credit him with
Demokritos’s clear distinction between genuine and
“bastard” knowledge, or that between what are now
called the primary and secondary qualities of matter.<a id='r983' /><a href='#f983' class='c014'><sup>[983]</sup></a>
These distinctions imply a conscious epistemological
theory, and all we are entitled to say is that the germs
of this were already to be found in the writings of
Leukippos and his predecessors. Of course, these do
not make Leukippos a sceptic any more than Empedokles
or Anaxagoras, whose remark on this subject
(fr. <a href='#An.21a'>21<i>a</i></a>) Demokritos is said to have quoted with
approval.<a id='r984' /><a href='#f984' class='c014'><sup>[984]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>There appear to be sufficient grounds for ascribing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>the theory of perception by means of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>simulacra</i></span> or
εἴδωλα, which played such a part in the systems of
Demokritos and Epicurus, to Leukippos.<a id='r985' /><a href='#f985' class='c014'><sup>[985]</sup></a> It is a very
natural development of the Empedoklean theory of
“effluences” (<a href='#sec118'>§ 118</a>). It hardly seems likely, however,
that he went into great detail on the subject, and it
is safer to credit Demokritos with the elaboration of the
theory.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Importance of Leukippos.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec183'></a>183. We have seen incidentally that there is a wide
divergence of opinion among recent writers as to the
place of Atomism in Greek thought. The question at
issue is really whether Leukippos reached his theory
on what are called “metaphysical grounds,” that is,
from a consideration of the Eleatic theory of reality, or
whether, on the contrary, it was a pure development of
Ionian science. The foregoing exposition will suggest
the true answer. So far as his general theory of the
physical constitution of the world is concerned, it has
been shown, I think, that it was derived entirely from
Eleatic and Pythagorean sources, while the detailed
cosmology was in the main a more or less successful
attempt to make the older Ionian beliefs fit into this
new physical theory. In any case, his greatness
consisted in his having been the first to see how body
must be regarded if we take it to be ultimate reality.
The old Milesian theory had found its most adequate
expression in the system of Anaximenes (<a href='#sec31'>§ 31</a>), but of
course rarefaction and condensation cannot be clearly
represented except on the hypothesis of molecules or
atoms coming closer together or going further apart in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>space. Parmenides had seen that very clearly (fr.<a href='#Pa.2'>2</a>),
and it was the Eleatic criticism which forced Leukippos
to formulate his system as he did. Even Anaxagoras
took account of Zeno’s arguments about divisibility
(<a href='#sec128'>§ 128</a>), but his system of qualitatively different “seeds”
was lacking in that simplicity which has always been
the chief attraction of atomism.</p>

<hr class='c017' />
<div class='footnote' id='f921'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r921'>921</a>. Theophrastos said he was an Eleate or a Milesian (R. P. 185), while
Diogenes (ix. 30) says he was an Eleate or, according to some, an Abderite.
These statements are exactly parallel to the discrepancies about the native
cities of the Pythagoreans already noted (Chap. VII. p. 327, <a href='#f763'><ins class='correction' title='n. 5'><i>n.</i> 763</ins></a>).
Diogenes adds that, according to others, Leukippos was a Melian, which
is a common confusion. Aetios (i. 7. 1) calls Diagoras of Melos a Milesian
(cf. <cite>Dox.</cite> p. 14). Demokritos was called by some a Milesian (R. P. 186)
for the same reason that Leukippos is called an Eleate. We may also
compare the doubt as to whether Herodotos called himself a Halikarnassian
or a Thourian.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f922'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r922'>922</a>. Diog. x. 13 (R. P. 185 b). The theory was revived by E. Rohde.
For the literature of the controversy, see R. P. 185 b. Diels’s refutation of
Rohde has convinced most competent judges. Brieger’s attempt to unsettle
the question again (<cite>Hermes</cite>, xxxvi. pp. 166 sqq.) is only half-hearted, and
quite unconvincing. As will be seen, however, I agree with his main
contention that atomism comes after the systems of Empedokles and
Anaxagoras.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f923'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r923'>923</a>. Diog. ix. 41 (R. P. 187). As Diels points out, the statement suggests
that Anaxagoras was dead when Demokritos wrote. It is probable, too,
that it was this which made Apollodoros fix the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>floruit</i></span> of Demokritos just
forty years after that of Anaxagoras (Jacoby, p. 290). We cannot make
much of the other statement of Demokritos that he wrote the Μικρὸς
διάκοσμος 750 years after the fall of Troy; for we cannot be sure what
era he used (Jacoby, p. 292).</p>

Tetr. iii. thus: (1) Μέγας διάκοσμος (ὃν οἱ περὶ Θεόφραστον Λευκίππου

<p class='c002'><a href='#r931'>931</a>. This point is important, though the argument is weakened by Brieger’s
overstatement of it in <cite>Hermes</cite>, xxxvi. p. 183. He says that to assume such
a reaction as Anaxagoreanism after the atomic system had once been
discovered would be something unexampled in the history of Greek
philosophy. Diogenes of Apollonia proves the contrary. The real point
is that Empedokles and Anaxagoras were men of a different stamp. So
far as Empedokles is concerned, Gomperz states the case rightly (<cite>Greek
Thinkers</cite>, vol. i. p. 560).</p>

wrote his book some time between 470 and 460 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, Leukippos can
hardly have written his before 450 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and even that is too late for him

<div class='footnote' id='f935'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r935'>935</a>. The words ὡς δοκεῖ do not imply assent to the view introduced by
them; indeed they are used, far more often than not, in reference to beliefs
which the writer does not accept. The translation “methinks” in
Gomperz, <cite>Greek Thinkers</cite>, vol. i. p. 345, is therefore most misleading,
and there is no justification for Brieger’s statement (<cite>Hermes</cite>, xxxvi. p. 165)
that Theophrastos dissents from Aristotle’s view as given in the passage
about to be quoted. We should be saved from many errors if we
accustomed ourselves to translate δοκεῖ by “is thought” or “is believed”
instead of by “seems.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f936'>
<p class='c002'><a href='#r936'>936</a>. This prejudice is apparent all through Gomperz’s <cite>Greek Thinkers</cite>,
and seriously impairs the value of that fascinating, though somewhat
imaginative work. It is amusing to notice that Brieger, from the same
point of view, regards the custom of making Anaxagoras the last of the
Presocratics as due to theological prepossessions (<cite>Hermes</cite>, xxxvi. p. 185).
I am sorry that I cannot agree with either side; but the bitterness of the
disputants bears witness to the fundamental importance of the questions
raised by the early Greek philosophers.</p>

As Diels suggests, the illustration from the letters of the alphabet is
probably due to Demokritos. It shows, in any case, how the word
στοιχεῖον came to be used later for “element.” We must read, with
Wilamowitz, τὸ δὲ Ζ τοῦ Η θέσει for τὸ δὲ Ζ τοῦ Ν θέσει, the older

anything else than the property of bodies in virtue of which they move

such as we find in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>de Caelo</cite></span>, 275 b 29 sqq. Aristotle there argues that,
as Leukippos and Demokritos made the φύσις of the atoms one, they were
bound to give them a single motion. That is just what Epicurus did, but
Aristotle’s argument implies that Leukippos and Demokritos did not.
Though he gave the atoms weight, Epicurus could not accept Aristotle’s
view that some bodies are naturally light. The appearance of lightness is
due to ἔκθλιψις, the squeezing out of the smaller atoms by the larger.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f963'>

Empedokles does not account for the weight of bodies on the earth (οὐ γὰρ

<p class='c002'><a href='#r967'>967</a>. This view was independently advocated by Brieger (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die Urbewegung
der Atome und die Weltentstehung bei Leucipp und Demokrit</cite></span>, 1884) and
Liepmann (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Die Mechanik der Leucipp-Demokritschen Atome</cite></span>, 1885),
both of whom unnecessarily weakened their position by admitting
that weight is an original property of the atoms. On the other hand,
Brieger denies that the weight of the atoms is the cause of their original
motion, while Liepmann says that before and outside the vortex there is
only a latent weight, a <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Pseudoschwere</i></span>, which only comes into operation
in the world. It is surely simpler to say that this weight, since it produces
no effect, does not yet exist. Zeller rightly argues against Brieger and
Liepmann that, if the atoms have weight, they must fall; but, so far as I
can see, nothing he says tells against their theory as I have restated it.
Gomperz adopts the Brieger-Liepmann explanation. See also Lortzing,

<p class='c002'><a id='sec184'></a>184. With Leukippos our story should properly come
to an end; for he had really answered the question
first asked by Thales. We have seen, however, that,
though his theory of matter was of a most original and
daring kind, he was not equally successful in his
attempt to construct a cosmology, and this seems to
have stood in the way of the recognition of the atomic
theory for what it really was. We have noted the
growing influence of medicine, and the consequent
substitution of an interest in detailed investigation for
the larger cosmological views of an earlier time,
and there are several treatises in the Hippokratean
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>corpus</i></span> which give us a clear idea of the interest which
now prevailed.<a id='r986' /><a href='#f986' class='c014'><sup>[986]</sup></a> Leukippos had shown that “the
doctrine of Melissos,”<a id='r987' /><a href='#f987' class='c014'><sup>[987]</sup></a> which seemed to make all
science impossible, was not the only conclusion that
could be drawn from the Eleatic premisses, and he had
gone on to give a cosmology which was substantially
of the old Ionic type. The result at first was simply
that all the old schools revived and had a short period
of renewed activity, while at the same time some new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>schools arose which sought to accommodate the older
views to those of Leukippos, or to make them more
available for scientific purposes by combining them in
an eclectic fashion. None of these attempts had any
lasting importance or influence, and what we have to
consider in this chapter is really one of the periodical
“bankruptcies of science” which mark the close of one
chapter in its history and announce the beginning of a
new one.</p>

<h3 id='X.1' class='c018'>I. <span class='sc'>Hippon of Samos</span></h3>

<p class='c022'><a id='sec185'></a>185. Hippon of Samos or Kroton belonged to the
Italian school of medicine.<a id='r988' /><a href='#f988' class='c014'><sup>[988]</sup></a> We know very little
indeed of him except that he was a contemporary of
Perikles. From a scholiast on Aristophanes<a id='r989' /><a href='#f989' class='c014'><sup>[989]</sup></a> we learn
that Kratinos satirised him in his <cite>Panoptai</cite>; and Aristotle
mentions him in the enumeration of early philosophers
given in the First Book of the <cite>Metaphysics</cite>,<a id='r990' /><a href='#f990' class='c014'><sup>[990]</sup></a> though
only to say that the inferiority of his intellect deprives
him of all claim to be reckoned among them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Moisture.</div>

<p class='c002'>With regard to his views, the most precise statement
is that of Alexander, who doubtless follows Theophrastos.
It is to the effect that he held the primary
substance to be Moisture, without deciding whether it
was Water or Air.<a id='r991' /><a href='#f991' class='c014'><sup>[991]</sup></a> We have the authority of Aristotle<a id='r992' /><a href='#f992' class='c014'><sup>[992]</sup></a>
and Theophrastos, represented by Hippolytos,<a id='r993' /><a href='#f993' class='c014'><sup>[993]</sup></a> for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>saying that this theory was supported by physiological
arguments of the kind common at the time. His other
views belong to the history of Medicine.</p>

<p class='c002'>Till quite recently no fragment of Hippon was known
to exist, but a single one has now been recovered from
the Geneva Scholia on Homer.<a id='r994' /><a href='#f994' class='c014'><sup>[994]</sup></a> It is directed against
the old assumption that the “waters under the earth”
are an independent source of moisture, and runs thus:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>The waters we drink are all from the sea; for if wells were
deeper than the sea, then it would not, doubtless, be from the
sea that we drink, for then the water would not be from the
sea, but from some other source. But as it is, the sea is
deeper than the waters, so all the waters that are above the
sea come from it. R. P. 219 b.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>We observe here the universal assumption that
water tends to rise from the earth, not to sink into it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Along with Hippon, Idaios of Himera<a id='r995' /><a href='#f995' class='c014'><sup>[995]</sup></a> may just be
mentioned. We really know nothing of him except
that he held air to be the primary substance. The
fact that he was of Sicilian origin is, however, suggestive.</p>

<h3 id='X.2' class='c018'>II. <span class='sc'>Diogenes of Apollonia</span></h3>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Date.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec186'></a>186. After discussing the three great representatives
of the Milesian school, Theophrastos went on to say:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>And Diogenes of Apollonia, too, who was almost the latest
of those who gave themselves up to these studies, wrote most
of his work in an eclectic fashion, agreeing in some points with
Anaxagoras and in others with Leukippos. He, too, says that
the primary substance of the universe is Air infinite and eternal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>from which by condensation, rarefaction, and change of state,
the form of everything else arises. R. P. 206 a.<a id='r996' /><a href='#f996' class='c014'><sup>[996]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>This passage shows that the Apolloniate was somewhat
later in date than the statement in Laertios
Diogenes<a id='r997' /><a href='#f997' class='c014'><sup>[997]</sup></a> that he was contemporary with Anaxagoras
would lead us to suppose, and the fact that he is
satirised in the <cite>Clouds</cite> of Aristophanes points in the
same direction.<a id='r998' /><a href='#f998' class='c014'><sup>[998]</sup></a> Of his life we know next to nothing.
He was the son of Apollothemis, and came from
Apollonia in Crete.<a id='r999' /><a href='#f999' class='c014'><sup>[999]</sup></a> The Ionic dialect in which he
wrote is no objection to this; it was the regular dialect
for cosmological works.<a id='r1000' /><a href='#f1000' class='c014'><sup>[1000]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>The fact that Diogenes was parodied in the <cite>Clouds</cite>
suggests that he had found his way to Athens; and we
have the excellent authority of Demetrios Phalereus<a id='r1001' /><a href='#f1001' class='c014'><sup>[1001]</sup></a>
for saying that the Athenians treated him in the usual
way. He excited so great dislike as nearly to imperil
his life.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Writings.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec187'></a>187. Simplicius affirms that Diogenes wrote several
works, though he allows that only one survived till his
own day, namely, the Περὶ φύσεως.<a id='r1002' /><a href='#f1002' class='c014'><sup>[1002]</sup></a> This statement is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>based upon references in the surviving work itself, and
is not to be lightly rejected. In particular, it is very
credible that he wrote a tract <cite>Against the Sophists</cite>, that
is to say, the pluralist cosmologists of the day.<a id='r1003' /><a href='#f1003' class='c014'><sup>[1003]</sup></a> That
he wrote a <cite>Meteorology</cite> and a book called <cite>The Nature
of Man</cite> is also quite probable. This would be a
physiological or medical treatise, and perhaps the
famous fragment about the veins comes from it.<a id='r1004' /><a href='#f1004' class='c014'><sup>[1004]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Fragments.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec188'></a>188. The work of Diogenes seems to have been
preserved in the Academy; practically all the fairly
extensive fragments which we still have are derived
from Simplicius. I give them as they are arranged by
Diels:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>(1) In beginning any discourse, it seems to me that one
should make one’s starting-point something indisputable, and
one’s expression simple and dignified. R. P. 207.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Di.2'></a>(2) My view is, to sum it all up, that all things are
differentiations of the same thing, and are the same thing.
And this is obvious; for, if the things which are now
in this world—earth, and water, and air and fire, and the
other things which we see existing in this world,—if any
one of these things, I say, were different from any other,
different, that is, by having a substance peculiar to itself;
and if it were not the same thing that is often changed and
differentiated, then things could not in any way mix with
one another, nor could they do one another good or harm.
Neither could a plant grow out of the earth, nor any animal
nor anything else come into being unless things were composed
in such a way as to be the same. But all these things
arise from the same thing; they are differentiated and take
different forms at different times, and return again to the
same thing. R. P. 208.</p>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>(3) For it would not be possible for it to be divided as it
is without intelligence, so as to keep the measures of all things,
of winter and summer, of day and night, of rains and winds
and fair weather. And any one who cares to reflect will find
that everything else is disposed in the best possible manner.
R. P. 210.</p>

<p class='c002'>(4) And, further, there are still the following great proofs.
Men and all other animals live upon air by breathing it, and
this is their soul and their intelligence, as will be clearly
shown in this work; while, when this is taken away, they die,
and their intelligence fails. R. P. 210.</p>

<p class='c002'><a id='Di.5'></a>(5) And my view is, that that which has intelligence is
what men call air, and that all things have their course
steered by it, and that it has power over all things. For this
very thing I hold to be a god,<a id='r1005' /><a href='#f1005' class='c014'><sup>[1005]</sup></a> and to reach everywhere, and
to dispose everything, and to be in everything; and there is
not anything which does not partake in it. Yet no single
thing partakes in it just in the same way as another; but
there are many modes both of air and of intelligence. For it
undergoes many transformations, warmer and colder, drier
and moister, more stable and in swifter motion, and it has
many other differentiations in it, and an infinite number of
colours and savours. And the soul of all living things is the
same, namely, air warmer than that outside us and in which
we are, but much colder than that near the sun. And this
warmth is not alike in any two kinds of living creatures, nor,
for the matter of that, in any two men; but it does not differ
much, only so far as is compatible with their being alike. At
the same time, it is not possible for any of the things which
are differentiated to be exactly like one another till they all
once more become the same.</p>

<p class='c002'>(6) Since, then, differentiation is multiform, living creatures
are multiform and many, and they are like one another neither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>in appearance nor in intelligence, because of the multitude of
differentiations. At the same time, they all live, and see, and
hear by the same thing, and they all have their intelligence
from the same source. R. P. 211.</p>

<p class='c002'>(7) And this itself is an eternal and undying body, but of
those things<a id='r1006' /><a href='#f1006' class='c014'><sup>[1006]</sup></a> some come into being and some pass away.</p>

<p class='c002'>(8) But this, too, appears to me to be obvious, that it is
both great, and mighty, and eternal, and undying, and of
great knowledge. R. P. 209.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>That the chief interest of Diogenes was a physiological
one, is clear from his elaborate account of the
veins, preserved by Aristotle.<a id='r1007' /><a href='#f1007' class='c014'><sup>[1007]</sup></a> It is noticeable, too,
that one of his arguments for the underlying unity of
all substances is that without this it would be impossible
to understand how one thing could do good or harm
to another (fr. <a href='#Di.2'>2</a>). In fact, the writing of Diogenes is
essentially of the same character as a good deal of
the pseudo-Hippokratean literature, and there is much
to be said for the view that the writers of these curious
tracts made use of him very much as they did of
Anaxagoras and Herakleitos.<a id='r1008' /><a href='#f1008' class='c014'><sup>[1008]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cosmology.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec189'></a>189. Like Anaximenes, Diogenes regarded Air as
the primary substance; but we see from his arguments
that he lived at a time when other views had become
prevalent. He speaks clearly of the four Empedoklean
elements (fr. <a href='#Di.2'>2</a>), and he is careful to attribute to Air
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>the attributes of Nous as taught by Anaxagoras (fr. <a href='#An.4'>4</a>).
The doxographical tradition as to his cosmological
views is fairly preserved:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Diogenes of Apollonia makes air the element, and holds
that all things are in motion, and that there are innumerable
worlds. And he describes the origin of the world thus.
When the All moves and becomes rare in one place and dense
in another, where the dense met together it formed a mass,
and then the other things arose in the same way, the lightest
parts occupying the highest position and producing the sun.
[Plut.] <cite>Strom.</cite> fr. 12 (R. P. 215).</p>

<p class='c002'>Nothing arises from what is not nor passes away into what
is not. The earth is round, poised in the middle, having
received its shape through the revolution proceeding from the
warm and its solidification from the cold. Diog. ix. 57
(R. P. 215).</p>

<p class='c002'>The heavenly bodies were like pumice-stone. He thinks
they are the breathing-holes of the world, and that they are
red-hot. Aet. ii. 13, 5 = Stob. i. 508 (R. P. 215).</p>

<p class='c002'>The sun was like pumice-stone, and into it the rays from
the aether fix themselves. Aet. ii. 20, 10. The moon was a
pumice-like conflagration. <i>Ib.</i> ii. 25, 10.</p>

<p class='c002'>Along with the visible heavenly bodies revolve invisible
stones, which for that very reason are nameless; but they
often fall and are extinguished on the earth like the stone star
which fell down flaming at Aigospotamos.<a id='r1009' /><a href='#f1009' class='c014'><sup>[1009]</sup></a> <i>Ib.</i> ii. 13, 9.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>We have here nothing more than the old Ionian
doctrine with a few additions from more recent sources.
Rarefaction and condensation still hold their place in
the explanation of the opposites, warm and cold, dry
and moist, stable and mobile (fr. <a href='#Di.5'>5</a>). The differentiations
into opposites which Air may undergo are, as
Anaxagoras had taught, infinite in number; but all
may be reduced to the primary opposition of rare and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>dense. We may gather, too, from Censorinus<a id='r1010' /><a href='#f1010' class='c014'><sup>[1010]</sup></a> that
Diogenes did not, like Anaximenes, speak of earth and
water as arising from Air by condensation, but rather
of blood, flesh, and bones. In this he followed
Anaxagoras (<a href='#sec130'>§ 130</a>), as it was natural that he should.
That portion of Air, on the other hand, which was
rarefied became fiery, and produced the sun and
heavenly bodies. The circular motion of the world is
due to the intelligence of the Air, as is also the division
of all things into different forms of body and the
observance of the “measures” by these forms.<a id='r1011' /><a href='#f1011' class='c014'><sup>[1011]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>Like Anaximander (<a href='#sec20'>§ 20</a>), Diogenes regarded the

had been partially evaporated by the sun, so as to
separate out the remaining earth.<a id='r1012' /><a href='#f1012' class='c014'><sup>[1012]</sup></a> The earth itself is

Its solidification by the cold is due to the fact that cold
is a form of condensation.</p>

<p class='c002'>Diogenes did not hold with the earlier cosmologists
that the heavenly bodies were made of air or fire, nor
yet with Anaxagoras, that they were stones. They
were, he said, pumice-like, a view in which we may
trace the influence of Leukippos. They were earthy,
indeed, but not solid, and the celestial fire permeated
their pores. And this explains why we do not see
the dark bodies which, in common with Anaxagoras,
he held to revolve along with the stars. They really
are solid stones, and therefore cannot be penetrated
by the fire. It was one of these that fell into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>Aigospotamos. Like Anaxagoras, Diogenes affirmed
that the inclination of the earth happened subsequently
to the rise of animals.<a id='r1014' /><a href='#f1014' class='c014'><sup>[1014]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'>We are prepared to find that Diogenes held the
doctrine of innumerable worlds; for it was the old
Milesian belief, and had just been revived by Anaxagoras
and Leukippos. He is mentioned with the rest
in the <cite>Placita</cite>; and if Simplicius classes him and
Anaximenes with Herakleitos as holding the Stoic
doctrine of successive formations and destructions of
a single world, he has probably been misled by the
“accommodators.”<a id='r1015' /><a href='#f1015' class='c014'><sup>[1015]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec190'></a>190. Living creatures arose from the earth, doubtless
under the influence of heat. Their souls, of course,
were air, and their differences were due to the various
degrees in which it was rarefied or condensed (fr. <a href='#Di.5'>5</a>).
No special seat, such as the heart or the brain, was
assigned to the soul; it was simply the warm air
circulating with the blood in the veins.</p>

theory of sensation too, as it is described by Theophrastos,<a id='r1017' /><a href='#f1017' class='c014'><sup>[1017]</sup></a>
need only be mentioned in passing. Briefly
stated, it amounts to this, that all sensation is due to
the action of air upon the brain and other organs,
while pleasure is aeration of the blood. But the details
of the theory can only be studied properly in connexion
with the Hippokratean writings; for Diogenes does not

combined with an entirely new enthusiasm for detailed

<p class='c002'><a id='sec192'></a>192. On the cosmology of Archelaos, Hippolytos<a id='r1022' /><a href='#f1022' class='c014'><sup>[1022]</sup></a>
writes as follows:—</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c002'>Archelaos was by birth an Athenian, and the son of
Apollodoros. He spoke of the mixture of matter in a similar
way to Anaxagoras, and of the first principles likewise. He
held, however, that there was a certain mixture immanent
even in Nous. And he held that there were two efficient
causes which were separated off from one another, namely,
the warm and the cold. The former was in motion, the
latter at rest. When the water was liquefied it flowed to the
centre, and there being burnt up it turned to earth and air,
the latter of which was borne upwards, while the former took
up its position below. These, then, are the reasons why the
earth is at rest, and why it came into being. It lies in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>centre, being practically no appreciable part of the universe.
(But the air rules over all things),<a id='r1023' /><a href='#f1023' class='c014'><sup>[1023]</sup></a> being produced by the
burning of the fire, and from its original combustion comes
the substance of the heavenly bodies. Of these the sun is
the largest, and the moon second; the rest are of various
sizes. He says that the heavens were inclined, and that then
the sun made light upon the earth, made the air transparent,
and the earth dry; for it was originally a pond, being high at
the circumference and hollow in the centre. He adduces as
a proof of this hollowness that the sun does not rise and set
at the same time for all peoples, as it ought to do if the earth
were level. As to animals, he says that when the earth was
first being warmed in the lower part where the warm and the
cold were mingled together, many living creatures appeared,
and especially men, all having the same manner of life, and
deriving their sustenance from the slime; they did not live
long, and later on generation from one another began. And
men were distinguished from the rest, and set up leaders, and
laws, and arts, and cities, and so forth. And he says that
Nous is implanted in all animals alike; for each of the
animals, as well as man, makes use of Nous, but some
quicker and some slower.</p>

</div>

<p class='c002'>It is not necessary to say much with regard to this
theory, which in many respects contrasts unfavourably
with its predecessors. It is clear that, just as Diogenes
had tried to introduce certain Anaxagorean ideas into
the philosophy of Anaximenes, so Archelaos sought to
bring Anaxagoreanism nearer to the old Ionic views
by supplementing it with the opposition of warm and
cold, rare and dense, and by stripping Nous of that
simplicity which had marked it off from the other
“things” in his master’s system. It was probably for
this reason, too, that Nous was no longer regarded as
the maker of the world.<a id='r1024' /><a href='#f1024' class='c014'><sup>[1024]</sup></a> Leukippos had made such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>force unnecessary. It may be added that this twofold
relation of Archelaos to his predecessors makes it very
credible that, as Aetios tells us,<a id='r1025' /><a href='#f1025' class='c014'><sup>[1025]</sup></a> he believed in innumerable
worlds; both Anaxagoras and the older
Ionians upheld that doctrine.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Conclusion.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='sec193'></a>193. The cosmology of Archelaos, like that of
Diogenes, has all the characteristics of the age to
which it belonged—an age of reaction, eclecticism,
and investigation of detail.<a id='r1026' /><a href='#f1026' class='c014'><sup>[1026]</sup></a> Hippon of Samos and
Idaios of Himera represent nothing more than the
feeling that philosophy had run into a blind alley,
from which it could only escape by trying back.
The Herakleiteans at Ephesos, impenetrably wrapped
up as they were in their own system, did little but
exaggerate its paradoxes and develop its more fanciful
side.<a id='r1027' /><a href='#f1027' class='c014'><sup>[1027]</sup></a> It was not enough for Kratylos to say with
Herakleitos (fr. 84) that you cannot step twice into
the same river; you could not do so even once.<a id='r1028' /><a href='#f1028' class='c014'><sup>[1028]</sup></a>
But in nothing was the total bankruptcy of the early
cosmology so clearly shown as in the work of Gorgias,
entitled <cite>Substance or the Non-existent</cite>, in which an
absolute nihilism was set forth and based upon the
Eleatic dialectic.<a id='r1029' /><a href='#f1029' class='c014'><sup>[1029]</sup></a> The fact is that philosophy, so long
as it clung to its old presuppositions, had nothing more
to say; for the answer of Leukippos to the question of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>Thales was really final. Fresh life must be given to
the speculative impulse by the raising of new problems,
those of knowledge and conduct, before any further
progress was possible; and this was done by the
“Sophists” and Sokrates. Then, in the hands of
Demokritos and Plato, philosophy took a new form,
and started on a fresh course.</p>

Hippokrates himself represented just the opposite tendency to that of those
writers. His great achievement was the separation of medicine from
philosophy, a separation most beneficial to both (Celsus, i. pr.). This is
why the Hippokratean corpus contains some works in which the “sophists”

the history of philosophy as it was before the rise of ethical
and epistemological inquiry; but when he does, his guidance
is simply invaluable. His artistic gift and his power of entering
into the thoughts of other men enabled him to describe
the views of early philosophers in a thoroughly objective
manner, and he never, except in a playful and ironical way,
sought to read unthought-of meanings into the words of his

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Aristotle.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.2'></a>2. As a rule, Aristotle’s statements about early philosophers
are less historical than Plato’s. Not that he failed to understand
the facts, but he nearly always discusses them from the
point of view of his own system. He is convinced that his
own philosophy accomplishes what all previous philosophers
had aimed at, and their systems are therefore regarded as
“lisping” attempts to formulate it (<cite>Met.</cite> Α, 10. 993 a 15).
It is also to be noted that Aristotle regards some systems in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>much more sympathetic way than others. He is distinctly
unfair to the Eleatics, for instance.</p>

<p class='c002'>It is often forgotten that Aristotle derived much of his
information from Plato, and we must specially observe that
he more than once takes Plato’s irony too literally.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Stoics.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.3'></a>3. The Stoics, and especially Chrysippos, paid great
attention to early philosophy, but their way of regarding it
was simply an exaggeration of Aristotle’s. They did not content
themselves with criticising their predecessors from their
own point of view; they seem really to have believed that the
early poets and thinkers held views hardly distinguishable
from theirs. The word συνοικειοῦν, which Cicero renders by
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>accommodare</i></span>, was used by Philodemos to denote this method
of interpretation,<a id='r1030' /><a href='#f1030' class='c014'><sup>[1030]</sup></a> which has had serious results upon our
tradition, especially in the case of Herakleitos (p. 157).</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Skeptics.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.4'></a>4. The same remarks apply <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span> to the
Skeptics. The interest of such a writer as Sextus Empiricus
in early philosophy is to show that skepticism went back to an
early date—as far as Xenophanes, in fact. But what he tells
us is often of value; for he frequently quotes early views as
to knowledge and sensation in support of his thesis.</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Neoplatonists.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.5'></a>5. Under this head we have chiefly to consider the commentators
on Aristotle in so far as they are independent of the
Theophrastean tradition. Their chief characteristic is what
Simplicius calls εὐγνωμοσύνη, that is, a liberal spirit of interpretation,
which makes all early philosophers agree with one
another in upholding the doctrine of a Sensible and an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>Intelligible World. It is, however, to Simplicius more
than any one else that we owe the preservation of the fragments.
He had, of course, the library of the Academy at
his disposal.</p>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Doxographi graeci</cite></span>.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.6'></a>6. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Doxographi graeci</cite></span> of Professor Hermann Diels
(1879) threw an entirely new light upon the filiation of the
later sources; and we can only estimate justly the value of
statements derived from these if we bear constantly in mind
the results of his investigation. Here it will only be possible
to give an outline which may help the reader to find his way
in the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Doxographi graeci</cite></span> itself.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<div class='sidenote'>The “Opinions” of Theophrastos</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.7'></a>7. By the term <em>doxographers</em> we understand all those
writers who relate the opinions of the Greek philosophers,
and who derive their material, directly or indirectly, from the
great work of Theophrastos, Φυσικῶν δοξῶν ιηʹ (Diog. v. 46).
Of this work, one considerable chapter, that entitled Περὶ
αἰσθήσεων, has been preserved (<cite>Dox.</cite> pp. 499-527). And
Usener, following Brandis, further showed that there were
important fragments of it contained in the commentary of
Simplicius (sixth cent. <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) on the First Book of Aristotle’s
Φυσικὴ ἀκρόασις (Usener, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Analecta Theophrastea</cite></span>, pp. 25 sqq.).
These extracts Simplicius seems to have borrowed in turn
from Alexander of Aphrodisias (<i>c.</i> 200 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>); cf. <cite>Dox.</cite> p. 112
sqq. We thus possess a very considerable portion of the
First Book, which dealt with the ἀρχαί as well as practically
the whole of the last Book.</p>

<p class='c002'>From these remains it clearly appears that the method of
Theophrastos was to discuss in separate books the leading
topics which had engaged the attention of philosophers from
Thales to Plato. The chronological order was not observed;
the philosophers were grouped according to the affinity of their
doctrine, the differences between those who appeared to agree
most closely being carefully noted. The First Book, however,
was in some degree exceptional; for in it the order was that of
the successive schools, and short historical and chronological
notices were inserted.</p>

<hr class='c019' />

<div class='sidenote'>Doxographers.</div>

<p class='c002'><span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span><a id='app1.8'></a>8. A work of this kind was, of course, a godsend to the
epitomators and compilers of handbooks, who flourished more
and more as the Greek genius declined. These either
followed Theophrastos in arranging the subject-matter under
heads, or else they broke up his work, and rearranged his
statements under the names of the various philosophers to
whom they applied. This latter class form the natural
transition between the doxographers proper and the biographers,
so I have ventured to distinguish them by the name of
<em>biographical doxographers</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>I. <span class='sc'>Doxographers Proper</span></h4>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The <cite>Placita</cite> and Stobaios.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.9'></a>9. These are now represented by two works, viz. the
<cite>Placita Philosophorum</cite>, included among the writings ascribed
to Plutarch, and the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Eclogae Physicae</cite></span> of John Stobaios (<i>c.</i> 470
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span>). The latter originally formed one work with the <cite>Florilegium</cite>
of the same author, and includes a transcript of some
epitome substantially identical with the pseudo-Plutarchean
<cite>Placita</cite>. It is, however, demonstrable that neither the <cite>Placita</cite>
nor the doxography of the <cite>Eclogae</cite> is the original of the
other. The latter is usually the fuller of the two, and yet
the former must be earlier; for it was used by Athenagoras
for his defence of the Christians in 177 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 4). It
was also the source of the notices in Eusebios and Cyril, and
of the <cite>History of Philosophy</cite> ascribed to Galen. From these
writers many important corrections of the text have been
derived (<cite>Dox.</cite> pp. 5 sqq.).</p>

<p class='c002'>Another writer who made use of the <cite>Placita</cite> is Achilles
(<em>not</em> Achilles Tatius). Extracts from his Εἰσαγωγή to the
<cite>Phaenomena</cite> of Aratos are included in the <cite>Uranologion</cite> of
Petavius, pp. 121-164. His date is uncertain, but probably
he belongs to the third century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 18).</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Aetios.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.10'></a>10. What, then, was the common source of the <cite>Placita</cite> and
the <cite>Eclogae</cite>? Diels has shown that Theodoret (<i>c.</i> 445 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>)
had access to it; for in some cases he gives a fuller form of
statements made in these two works. Not only so, but he
also names that source; for he refers us (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gr. aff. cur.</cite></span> iv. 31)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>to Ἀετίου τὴν περὶ ἀρεσκόντων συναγωγήν. Diels has accordingly
printed the <cite>Placita</cite> in parallel columns with the relevant
parts of the <cite>Eclogae</cite>, under the title of <cite>Aetii Placita</cite>. The
quotations from “Plutarch” by later writers, and the extracts
of Theodoret from Aetios, are also given at the foot of each
page.</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The <cite>Vetusta Placita</cite>.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.11'></a>11. Diels has shown further, however, that Aetios did not
draw directly from Theophrastos, but from an intermediate
epitome which he calls the <cite>Vetusta Placita</cite>, traces of which
may be found in Cicero (<i>infra</i>, § 12), and in Censorinus (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De
die natali</cite></span>), who follows Varro. The <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vetusta Placita</cite></span> were
composed in the school of Poseidonios, and Diels now calls
them the Poseidonian Ἀρέσκοντα (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Über das phys. System des
Straton</cite></span>, p. 2). There are also traces of them in the “Homeric
Allegorists.”</p>

<p class='c002'>It is quite possible, by discounting the somewhat unintelligent
additions which Aetios made from Epicurean and
other sources, to form a pretty accurate table of the contents
of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vetusta Placita</cite></span> (<cite>Dox.</cite> pp. 181 sqq.), and this gives
us a fair idea of the arrangement of the original work by
Theophrastos.</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cicero.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.12'></a>12. So far as what he tells us of the earliest Greek philosophy
goes, Cicero must be classed with the doxographers,
and not with the philosophers; for he gives us nothing but
extracts at second or third hand from the work of Theophrastos.
Two passages in his writings fall to be considered under this
head, namely, “Lucullus” (<cite>Acad.</cite> ii.), 118, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>De natura
Deorum</cite></span>, i. 25-41.</p>

<p class='c002'>(<i>a</i>) <i>Doxography of the “Lucullus.”</i>—This contains a meagre
and inaccurately-rendered summary of the various opinions
held by philosophers with regard to the ἀρχή (<cite>Dox.</cite>
pp. 119 sqq.), and would be quite useless if it did not in one
case enable us to verify the exact words of Theophrastos
(Chap. I. p. 52, <a href='#f93'><i>n.</i> 2</a>). The doxography has come through
the hands of Kleitomachos, who succeeded Karneades in the
headship of the Academy (129 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>).</p>

<p class='c002'>(<i>b</i>) <i>Doxography of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“De natura Deorum.”</span></i>—A fresh light
was thrown upon this important passage by the discovery at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>Herculaneum of a roll containing fragments of an Epicurean
treatise, so like it as to be at once regarded as its original.
This treatise was at first ascribed to Phaidros, on the ground
of the reference in <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epp. ad Att.</cite></span> xiii. 39. 2; but the real title,
Φιλοδήμου περὶ εὐσεβείας, was afterwards restored (<cite>Dox.</cite> p. 530).
Diels, however, has shown (<cite>Dox.</cite> pp. 122 sqq.) that there is
much to be said for the view that Cicero did not copy
Philodemos, but that both drew from a common source (no
doubt Phaidros, Περὶ θεῶν) which itself went back to a Stoic
epitome of Theophrastos. The passage of Cicero and the
relevant fragments of Philodemos are edited in parallel
columns by Diels (<cite>Dox.</cite> pp. 531 sqq.).</p>

<h4 class='c026'>II. <span class='sc'>Biographical Doxographers</span></h4>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Hippolytos.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.13'></a>13. Of the “biographical doxographies,” the most important
is Book I. of the <cite>Refutation of all Heresies</cite> by Hippolytos.
This had long been known as the <cite>Philosophoumena</cite> of Origen;
but the discovery of the remaining books, which were first
published at Oxford in 1854, showed finally that it could not
belong to him. It is drawn mainly from some good epitome
of Theophrastos, in which the matter was already rearranged
under the names of the various philosophers. We must note,
however, that the sections dealing with Thales, Pythagoras,
Herakleitos, and Empedokles come from an inferior source,
some merely biographical compendium full of apocryphal
anecdotes and doubtful statements.</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>The <i>Stromateis</i>.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.14'></a>14. The fragments of the pseudo-Plutarchean <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Stromateis</cite></span>,
quoted by Eusebios in his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Praeparatio Evangelica</cite></span>, come from
a source similar to that of the best portions of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Philosophoumena</cite></span>.
So far as we can judge, they differ chiefly in two
points. In the first place, they are mostly taken from the
earliest sections of the work, and therefore most of them deal
with the primary substance, the heavenly bodies and the earth.
In the second place, the language is a much less faithful
transcript of the original.</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>“Diogenes Laertios.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.15'></a>15. The scrap-book which goes by the name of Diogenes
Laertios, or Laertios Diogenes (cf. Usener, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Epicurea</cite></span>, pp. 1 sqq.),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>contains large fragments of two distinct doxographies. One
is of the merely biographical, anecdotic, and apophthegmatic
kind used by Hippolytos in his first four chapters; the
other is of a better class, more like the source of Hippolytos’
remaining chapters. An attempt is made to disguise this
“contamination” by referring to the first doxography as a
“summary” (κεφαλαιωδής) account, while the second is called
“particular” (ἐπὶ μέρους).</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Patristic doxographies.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.16'></a>16. Short doxographical summaries are to be found in
Eusebios (<cite>P. E.</cite> x., xiv., xv.), Theodoret (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Gr. aff. cur.</cite></span> ii. 9-11),
Irenæus (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>C. haer.</cite></span> ii. 14), Arnobius (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Adv. nat.</cite></span> ii. 9), Augustine
(<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Civ. Dei</cite></span>, viii. 2). These depend mainly upon the writers of
“Successions,” whom we shall have to consider in the next
section.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><i>C.</i>—BIOGRAPHERS</h3>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Successions.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.17'></a>17. The first to write a work entitled <cite>Successions of the
Philosophers</cite> was Sotion (Diog. ii. 12; R. P. 4 a), about
200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> The arrangement of his work is explained in <cite>Dox.</cite>
p. 147. It was epitomised by Herakleides Lembos. Other
writers of Διαδοχαί were Antisthenes, Sosikrates, and Alexander.
All these compositions were accompanied by a very meagre
doxography, and made interesting by the addition of unauthentic
apophthegms and apocryphal anecdotes.</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Hermippos.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.18'></a>18. The peripatetic Hermippos of Smyrna, known as
Καλλιμάχειος (<i>c.</i> 200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), wrote several biographical works
which are frequently quoted. The biographical details are
very untrustworthy indeed; but sometimes bibliographical
information is added, which doubtless rests upon the Πίνακες
of Kallimachos.</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Satyros.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.19'></a>19. Another peripatetic, Satyros, the pupil of Aristarchos,
wrote (<i>c.</i> 160 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) <cite>Lives of Famous Men</cite>. The same remarks
apply to him as to Hermippos. His work was epitomised by
Herakleides Lembos.</p>

<div  class='c013'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>“Diogenes Laertios.”</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.20'></a>20. The work which goes by the name of Laertios
Diogenes is, in its biographical parts, a mere patchwork of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>earlier learning. It has not been digested or composed by
any single mind at all. It is little more than a collection
of extracts made at haphazard, possibly by more than one
successive possessor of the MS. But, of course, it contains
much that is of the greatest value.</p>

<h3 class='c018'><i>D.</i>—CHRONOLOGISTS</h3>

<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Eratosthenes and Apollodoros.</div>

<p class='c002'><a id='app1.21'></a>21. The founder of ancient chronology was Eratosthenes
of Kyrene (275-194 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>); but his work was soon supplanted
by the metrical version of Apollodoros (<i>c.</i> 140 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), from
which most of our information as to the dates of early
philosophers is derived. See Diels’ paper on the Χρονικά of
Apollodoros in <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Rhein. Mus.</cite></span> xxxi.; and Jacoby, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Apollodors
Chronik</cite></span> (1902).</p>

<p class='c002'>The method adopted is as follows:—If the date of some
striking event in a philosopher’s life is known, that is taken as
his <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>floruit</i></span> (ἀκμή), and he is assumed to have been forty
years old at that date. In default of this, some historical era
is taken as the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><i>floruit</i></span>. Of these the chief are the eclipse of
Thales 586/5 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, the taking of Sardeis in 546/5 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, the
accession of Polykrates in 532/1 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, and the foundation of
Thourioi in 444/3 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Further details will easily be found

<p class='c002'>When Burnet gives the fragments of a Greek philosopher, he does so
selectively, resulting in gaps in the sequence. Internal references
to those fragments in the text or footnotes have been linked for
easy navigation. References to the fragments in the footnotes are
sometimes technical discussions of the reading in Greek, and these
are not linked. There are also references to fragments which are not
among those the Burnet provides.</p>

<p class='c002'>Some quoted and translated passages, printed as prose, also include
line numbers in the right margin. These now appear on the right hand edge,
at the place in the text where they originally appeared.  The actual line
count, depending on your reader, may vary with page width. Therefore,
these numbers should be regarded as approximate.</p>

<p class='c002'>In note <a href='#f813'>813</a>, the Greek phrase includes an unmatched closing bracket.
This is a direct quotation from p. 234 of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Scholia in Lucianum</cite></span>, edited by Hugo Rabe.
The bracket was used by Rabe to separate the topic (the pentagram) from its
gloss.</p>

<p class='c002'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
